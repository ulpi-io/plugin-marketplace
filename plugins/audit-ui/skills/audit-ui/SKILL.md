# UI Audit

Final-pass audit workflow for web interfaces. Focuses on concrete issues with concrete fixes.

## Trigger Cues

Use this skill when:
- The user asks for a UI quality audit, design QA, polish pass, or pre-release review
- The task requires accessibility, keyboard, form usability, typography, or interaction checks
- The request includes loading/error/empty states, responsiveness, or visual stability checks

## Audit Workflow

Copy and track this checklist during the audit:

```text
Audit progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Scope changed surfaces and select relevant categories
- [ ] Step 2: Run CRITICAL checks first (a11y, interaction, forms)
- [ ] Step 3: Run HIGH/MEDIUM checks for the same surfaces
- [ ] Step 4: Report findings with file:line and concrete fixes
- [ ] Step 5: Re-check touched files and mark passes
```

1. Audit only changed pages/components unless a full sweep is requested.
2. Prioritize `CRITICAL` and `HIGH` findings before medium-priority polish.
3. For motion behavior, also apply `ui-animation` for timing/easing/reduced-motion details.
4. After fixes, rerun the relevant rules before finalizing.

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Accessibility and Semantics | CRITICAL | `a11y-` |
| 2 | Keyboard and Interaction | CRITICAL | `interaction-` |
| 3 | Forms and Validation | CRITICAL | `forms-` |
| 4 | Typography and Readability | HIGH | `type-` |
| 5 | Navigation and Feedback | HIGH | `nav-` |
| 6 | Layout and Resilience | HIGH | `layout-` |
| 7 | Performance and Visual Stability | HIGH | `perf-` |
| 8 | Motion and Theme Behavior | HIGH | `motion-` |
| 9 | Content and Microcopy | MEDIUM | `copy-` |

## Quick Reference

Read only what is needed for the current audit scope:
- Category map and impact rationale: `rules/_sections.md`
- Rule-level guidance and examples: `rules/<prefix>-*.md`
- Full craft sweep: `craft-checklist.md`
- Typography deep sweep: `typography-checklist.md`

Example rule files:

```
rules/a11y-semantic-html-first.md
rules/forms-inline-errors-first-focus.md
rules/perf-image-dimensions-and-priority.md
```

Each rule file contains:
- Why the rule matters
- Incorrect example
- Correct example

## Review Output Contract

Report findings in this format:

```markdown
## UI Audit Findings

### path/to/file.tsx
- [CRITICAL] `a11y-icon-controls-labeled`: Icon button is missing an accessible name.
  - Fix: Add `aria-label="Close dialog"` (or visible text label).

### path/to/clean-file.tsx
- ✓ pass
```

- Group findings by file.
- Use `file:line` when line numbers are available.
- State issue and propose a concrete fix.
- Include clean files as `✓ pass`.
