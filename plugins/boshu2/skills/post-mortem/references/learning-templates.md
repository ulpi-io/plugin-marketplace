## Memory Storage Template

For MCP `memory_store`:

```python
mcp__ai-platform__memory_store(
    content="[Concise learning statement - max 200 words]",
    memory_type="fact",  # fact | preference | episode
    source=f"post-mortem:{epic_id}",
    tags=[
        f"epic:{epic_id}",
        "learning",
        "topic:specific-topic",
        "rig:rig-name",
        "verified:yes"  # or "verified:no" - never use confidence scores
    ]
    # Note: Use "verified:yes/no" tags, NOT confidence scores (0.92, 0.91).
    # Verification requires source citation or multiple observations.
)
```

### Memory Types

| Type | Use For | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `fact` | Learned information | "Pre-mortem simulation catches 80% of spec issues" |
| `preference` | User/project choices | "This project prefers snake_case over camelCase" |
| `episode` | Significant events | "Wave 6 timeout issue resolved by increasing limit to 900s" |

### Tag Conventions

| Tag Prefix | Purpose | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| `epic:` | Link to source epic | `epic:jc-9tx6` |
| `topic:` | Subject area | `topic:security` |
| `rig:` | Which rig | `rig:athena` |
| `pattern:` | If a pattern | `pattern:pre-mortem` |
| `tool:` | If about a tool | `tool:upgrade.py` |

## Quick Extraction Workflow

```bash
# 1. Identify learnings from commits
git log --oneline --since="7 days ago" --grep="$EPIC" | while read commit; do
    echo "Commit: $commit"
    git show $commit --stat
    echo "---"
done

# 2. Identify friction from beads
bd list --parent=$EPIC | while read issue; do
    status=$(bd show $issue | grep "Status:")
    comments=$(bd show $issue | grep -c "Comment:")
    retries=$(bd show $issue | grep -c "retry\|Retry")
    echo "$issue: status=$status, comments=$comments, retries=$retries"
done

# 3. Create artifacts
mkdir -p .agents/{learnings,patterns,retros}

# 4. Store memories
for learning in "${LEARNINGS[@]}"; do
    mcp__ai-platform__memory_store(content="$learning", ...)
done
```

## Quality Criteria for Learnings

A good learning:
- [ ] Is specific (not generic advice)
- [ ] Has evidence (commits, issues, discussions)
- [ ] Is actionable (can be applied)
- [ ] Has context (when it applies)
- [ ] Is findable (good tags)
- [ ] Has verification status (verified: yes/no with method, NOT confidence scores)

A good pattern:
- [ ] Solves a real problem (not hypothetical)
- [ ] Has been used (not theoretical)
- [ ] Has trade-offs documented
- [ ] Has code examples
- [ ] Explains when NOT to use it
