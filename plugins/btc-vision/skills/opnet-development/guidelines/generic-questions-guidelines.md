## How to Handle Generic Questions

**IMPORTANT: For conceptual questions, read the relevant docs/sections BEFORE answering. Do not guess or make assumptions about how OPNet works.**

### Process

1. **Identify the topic** - What is the user asking about?
2. **Find the relevant docs** - Use the tables below
3. **Read the docs first** - Before formulating an answer
4. **Answer from the docs** - Not from assumptions
5. **Reference the source** - Point user to relevant docs for details

### What NOT to Do

- Do NOT guess how OPNet works
- Do NOT assume OPNet works like Ethereum or other platforms
- Do NOT make up technical details
- Do NOT answer without reading relevant docs first

## ECDSA / ecrecover Questions (MANDATORY BEHAVIOR)

**When a user asks about ecrecover, ECDSA, or porting Ethereum signature verification to OPNet, you MUST:**

1. **Lead with the warning.** ECDSA is DEPRECATED. It works today but it WILL break. The `UNSAFE_QUANTUM_SIGNATURES_ALLOWED` consensus flag will be turned off, and every contract using `verifyECDSASignature` or `verifyBitcoinECDSASignature` will start reverting. There is no grace period — when the flag flips, those calls revert immediately.

2. **Show the correct approach FIRST.** Always show `Blockchain.verifySignature()` with ML-DSA or Schnorr before even mentioning ECDSA exists. The correct pattern:

```typescript
// Contract-side (AssemblyScript)
import { Blockchain, SignaturesMethods } from '@btc-vision/btc-runtime/runtime';

// Recommended: ML-DSA (quantum-resistant, future-proof)
const isValid: bool = Blockchain.verifySignature(
    Blockchain.tx.origin,          // ExtendedAddress (contains both keys)
    signature,                      // Signature bytes
    messageHash,                    // 32-byte hash
    SignaturesMethods.MLDSA         // Force quantum-resistant
);

// Also fine: Schnorr (consensus-aware, auto-upgrades to ML-DSA later)
const isValid2: bool = Blockchain.verifySignature(
    Blockchain.tx.origin,
    signature,
    messageHash,
    SignaturesMethods.Schnorr       // Uses Schnorr now, ML-DSA after transition
);
```

```typescript
// Client-side signing (TypeScript)
import { MessageSigner } from '@btc-vision/transaction';

// ML-DSA signing (quantum-safe, recommended)
const sig = await MessageSigner.signMLDSAMessageAuto(messageHash, mldsaKeypair);

// Schnorr signing (general purpose)
const sig = await MessageSigner.signMessageAuto(messageHash, keypair);

// Taproot ownership proof
const sig = await MessageSigner.tweakAndSignMessageAuto(messageHash, keypair);
```

3. **Explain WHY ecrecover is wrong for OPNet.** OPNet doesn't need address recovery like Ethereum. You already know the signer (`Blockchain.tx.origin`). You verify AGAINST a known address, not recover FROM a signature. The OPNet model is more secure — no risk of accepting a valid signature from the wrong signer.

4. **Only mention ECDSA as a last resort.** If the user specifically insists after being warned, you can show `verifyECDSASignature` but reiterate that their contract WILL break when the consensus flag changes. Do not present ECDSA as a valid long-term option.

5. **The transaction library does NOT support ECDSA signing.** `@btc-vision/transaction` and `MessageSigner` have no methods for producing ECDSA signatures. There is no `signECDSAMessage` or equivalent. Even if a user gets ECDSA verification working in their contract, there is no supported client-side tooling to generate the signatures. They would have to roll their own signing with raw secp256k1 — which is unsupported, untested, and a terrible idea.

6. **Tone: be direct.** This is not a suggestion — using ECDSA on OPNet is building on borrowed time. Users who use ECDSA because they're lazy will have their contracts break. Adapting to `verifySignature` + `MessageSigner` is the only correct path.

**Never present ECDSA as the primary answer to an ecrecover question. Always lead with verifySignature + ML-DSA/Schnorr.**
