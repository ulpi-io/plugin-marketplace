<objective>
Help design and analyze business models using the Business Model Canvas framework - 9 interconnected building blocks that describe how a company creates, delivers, and captures value.
</objective>

<quick_start>
**Generate a canvas:**
```
/business-model canvas for [company/idea]
```

Claude will analyze all 9 blocks:
1. Customer Segments (who are we serving?)
2. Value Propositions (what value do we deliver?)
3. Channels (how do we reach customers?)
4. Customer Relationships (how do we engage?)
5. Revenue Streams (how do we make money?)
6. Key Resources (what do we need?)
7. Key Activities (what must we do?)
8. Key Partnerships (who helps us?)
9. Cost Structure (what does it cost?)
</quick_start>

<the_9_blocks>

## 1. Customer Segments
**Question:** For whom are we creating value? Who are our most important customers?

**Types:**

## Canvas Generation Process

### Step 1: Identify Customer Segments
```
For each potential segment:
  - Define demographics/firmographics
  - Assess market size
  - Evaluate accessibility
  - Score attractiveness (1-10)

Prioritize: Focus on top 2-3 segments
```

### Step 2: Define Value Propositions
```
For each priority segment:
  - List jobs-to-be-done
  - Identify pains to relieve
  - Identify gains to create
  - Match to value types above

Map: segment → value proposition(s)
```

### Step 3: Design Channels
```
For each channel phase:
  - Awareness: [channels]
  - Evaluation: [channels]
  - Purchase: [channels]
  - Delivery: [channels]
  - After-sales: [channels]

Optimize: Cost vs reach vs customer preference
```

### Step 4: Define Customer Relationships
```
For each segment:
  - Determine relationship type
  - Consider acquisition cost
  - Plan retention strategy
  - Define upsell path
```

### Step 5: Establish Revenue Streams
```
For each value proposition:
  - Select revenue type
  - Choose pricing mechanism
  - Estimate willingness to pay
  - Project revenue potential
```

### Step 6: Identify Key Resources
```
For value propositions + channels + relationships:
  - List required physical resources
  - List required intellectual resources
  - List required human resources
  - List required financial resources
```

### Step 7: Define Key Activities
```
For each key resource:
  - Define activities to acquire
  - Define activities to maintain
  - Define activities to leverage

Categorize: Production / Problem Solving / Platform
```

### Step 8: Establish Key Partnerships
```
For each activity not core to business:
  - Evaluate build vs buy vs partner
  - Identify potential partners
  - Define partnership type
  - Establish terms
```

### Step 9: Calculate Cost Structure
```
Sum all costs:
  - Fixed costs (resources, overhead)
  - Variable costs (per unit)
  - Partnership costs

Determine: Cost-driven or Value-driven approach
```
