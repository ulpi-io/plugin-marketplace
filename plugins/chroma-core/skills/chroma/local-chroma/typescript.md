## Local Chroma

Running Chroma locally is useful for development, testing, and applications where data privacy or offline operation is important. Local Chroma stores data on disk and runs as a separate process that your application connects to over HTTP.

### When to use local vs cloud

**Use local Chroma when:**
- Developing and testing before deploying to production
- Data must stay on-premises for compliance or privacy reasons
- You need offline operation without network dependencies
- Running integration tests in CI/CD pipelines

**Use Chroma Cloud when:**
- You need the Schema() and Search() APIs for advanced indexing
- You want managed infrastructure without operational overhead
- You need hybrid search with SPLADE or other cloud-only features
- Scaling beyond what a single machine can handle

### Installation

For Python, install with pip or uv:

```
pip install chromadb
# or
uv pip install chromadb
```

To start the Chroma server from a Python environment:

```
chroma run
```

By default, this starts Chroma on `localhost:8000` and persists data to a local directory.

For JavaScript/TypeScript, install with npm:

```
npm install chromadb
```

To start the Chroma server:

```
npx chroma run
```

### Connecting to local Chroma

```typescript
import { ChromaClient } from 'chromadb';
import { DefaultEmbeddingFunction } from '@chroma-core/default-embed';
```

Once the server is running, connect using the `ChromaClient` (not `CloudClient`):

```typescript
// client with no args uses local chroma instance
const client = new ChromaClient();

const embeddingFunction = new DefaultEmbeddingFunction();

const collection = await client.getOrCreateCollection({
  name: 'my_collection',
  embeddingFunction,
});

await collection.add({
  ids: ['doc1', 'doc2'],
  documents: [
    'Apples are really good red fruit',
    'Red cars tend to get more speeding tickets',
  ],
});

const results = await collection.query({
  queryTexts: ['I like red apples'],
});

const firstResult = results.documents[0];
```

### Persistence

Local Chroma persists data to disk automatically. By default, data is stored in `.chroma/` in the current directory. You can specify a different path when starting the server:

```
chroma run --path /path/to/data
```

This makes it safe to restart the server without losing your indexed documents.
