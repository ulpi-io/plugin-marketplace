## Python Bytecode Reversing (dis.dis output)

### Common Pattern: XOR Validation with Split Indices

Challenge gives raw CPython bytecode (dis.dis disassembly). Common pattern:
1. Check flag length
2. XOR chars at even indices with key1, compare to list p1
3. XOR chars at odd indices with key2, compare to list p2

**Reversing:**
```python
# Given: p1, p2 (expected values), key1, key2 (XOR keys)
flag = [''] * flag_length
for i in range(len(p1)):
    flag[2*i] = chr(p1[i] ^ key1)      # Even indices
    flag[2*i+1] = chr(p2[i] ^ key2)    # Odd indices
print(''.join(flag))
```

### Bytecode Analysis Tips
- `LOAD_CONST` followed by `COMPARE_OP` reveals expected values
- `BINARY_XOR` identifies the transformation
- `BUILD_TUPLE`/`BUILD_LIST` with constants = expected output array
- Loop structure: `FOR_ITER` + `BINARY_SUBSCR` = iterating over flag chars
- `CALL_FUNCTION` on `ord` = character-to-int conversion

## Python Opcode Remapping

### Identification
Decompiler fails with opcode errors.

### Recovery
1. Find modified `opcode.pyc` in PyInstaller bundle
2. Compare with original Python opcodes
3. Build mapping: `{new_opcode: original_opcode}`
4. Patch target .pyc
5. Decompile normally

---

## DOS Stub Analysis

PE files can hide code in DOS stub:
1. Check for large DOS stub in Ghidra/IDA
2. Run in DOSBox
3. Load in IDA as 16-bit DOS
4. Look for `int 16h` (keyboard input)

---

## Unity IL2CPP Games

- Use Il2CppDumper to dump symbols
- Look for `Start()` functions
- Key derivation: `key = SHA256(companyName + "\n" + productName)`
- Decrypt server responses with derived key

---

## Brainfuck/Esolangs

- Check if compiled with known tools (BF-it)
- Understand tape/memory model
- Static analysis of cell operations

---

## UEFI Binary Analysis

```bash
7z x firmware.bin -oextracted/
file extracted/* | grep "PE32+"
```

- Bootkit replaces boot loader
- Custom VM protects decryption
- Lift VM bytecode to C

---

## Transpilation to C

For heavily obfuscated code:
```python
for opcode, args in instructions:
    if opcode == 'XOR':
        print(f"r{args[0]} ^= r{args[1]};")
    elif opcode == 'ADD':
        print(f"r{args[0]} += r{args[1]};")
```

Compile with `-O3` for constant folding.

## Code Coverage Side-Channel Attack

**Pattern (Coverup, Nullcon 2026):** PHP challenge provides XDebug code coverage data alongside encrypted output.

**How it works:**
- PHP code uses `xdebug_start_code_coverage(XDEBUG_CC_UNUSED | XDEBUG_CC_DEAD_CODE | XDEBUG_CC_BRANCH_CHECK)`
- Encryption uses data-dependent branches: `if ($xored == chr(0)) ... if ($xored == chr(1)) ...`
- Coverage JSON reveals which branches were executed during encryption
- This leaks the set of XOR intermediate values that occurred

**Exploitation:**
```python
import json

# Load coverage data
with open('coverage.json') as f:
    cov = json.load(f)

# Extract executed XOR values from branch coverage
executed_xored = set()
for line_no, hit_count in cov['encrypt.php']['lines'].items():
    if hit_count > 0:
        # Map line numbers to the chr(N) value in the if-statement
        executed_xored.add(extract_value_from_line(line_no))

# For each position, filter candidates
for pos in range(len(ciphertext)):
    candidates = []
    for key_byte in range(256):
        xored = plaintext_byte ^ key_byte  # or reverse S-box lookup
        if xored in executed_xored:
            candidates.append(key_byte)
    # Combined with known plaintext prefix, this uniquely determines key
```

**Key insight:** Code coverage is a powerful oracle — it tells you which conditional paths were taken. Any encryption with data-dependent branching leaks information through coverage.

**Mitigation detection:** Look for branchless/constant-time crypto implementations that defeat this attack.

## Functional Language Reversing (OPAL)

**Pattern (Opalist, Nullcon 2026):** Binary compiled from OPAL (Optimized Applicative Language), a purely functional language.

**Recognition markers:**
- `.impl` (implementation) and `.sign` (signature) source files
- `IMPLEMENTATION` / `SIGNATURE` keywords
- Nested `IF..THEN..ELSE..FI` structures
- Functions named `f1`, `f2`, ... `fN` (numeric naming)
- Heavy use of `seq[nat]`, `string`, `denotation` types

**Reversing approach:**
1. Pure functions are mathematically invertible — reverse each step in the pipeline
2. Identify the transformation chain: `f_final(f_n(...f_2(f_1(input))...))`
3. For each function, build the inverse

**Aggregate brute-force for scramble functions:**
When a transformation accumulates state that depends on original (unknown) values:
```python
# Example: f8 adds cumulative offset based on parity of original bytes
# offset contribution per element depends on whether pre-scramble value is even/odd
# Total offset S = sum of contributions, but S mod 256 has only 256 possibilities

decoded = base64_decode(target)
for total_offset_S in range(256):
    candidate = [(b - total_offset_S) % 256 for b in decoded]
    # Verify: recompute S from candidate values
    recomputed_S = sum(contribution(i, candidate[i]) for i in range(len(candidate))) % 256
    if recomputed_S == total_offset_S:
        # Apply remaining inverse steps
        result = apply_inverse_substitution(candidate)
        if all(32 <= c < 127 for c in result):
            print(bytes(result))
```

**Key lesson:** When a scramble function has a chicken-and-egg dependency (result depends on original, which is unknown), brute-force the aggregate effect (often mod 256 = 256 possibilities) rather than all possible states (exponential).

## Python Version-Specific Bytecode (VuwCTF 2025)

**Pattern (A New Machine):** Challenge targets specific Python version (e.g., 3.14.0 alpha).

**Key requirement:** Compile that exact Python version to disassemble bytecode — alpha/beta versions have different opcodes than stable releases.

```bash
# Build specific Python version
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.14.0/Python-3.14.0a4.tar.xz
tar xf Python-3.14.0a4.tar.xz
cd Python-3.14.0a4 && ./configure && make -j$(nproc)
./python -c "import dis, marshal; dis.dis(marshal.loads(open('challenge.pyc','rb').read()[16:]))"
```

**Common validation:** Flag compared against tuple of squared ASCII values:
```python
# Reverse: flag[i] = sqrt(expected_tuple[i])
import math
flag = ''.join(chr(int(math.isqrt(v))) for v in expected_values)
```

---

## Non-Bijective Substitution Cipher Reversing

**Pattern (Coverup, Nullcon 2026):** S-box/substitution table has collisions (multiple inputs map to same output).

**Detection:**
```python
sbox = [...]  # substitution table
if len(set(sbox)) < len(sbox):
    print("Non-bijective! Collisions exist.")
```

**Building reverse lookup:**
```python
from collections import defaultdict
rev_sub = defaultdict(list)
for i, v in enumerate(sbox):
    rev_sub[v].append(i)
# rev_sub[output] = [list of possible inputs]
```

**Disambiguation strategies:**
1. Known plaintext format (e.g., `ENO{`, `flag{`) fixes key bytes at known positions
2. Side-channel data (code coverage, timing) eliminates impossible candidates
3. Printable ASCII constraint (32-126) reduces candidate space
4. Re-encrypt candidates and verify against known ciphertext

## Roblox Place File Analysis

**Pattern (MazeRunna, 0xFun 2026):** Roblox game with flag hidden in older version; latest version contains decoy.

**Version history via Asset Delivery API:**
```bash
# Extract placeId and universeId from game page HTML
# Query each version (requires .ROBLOSECURITY cookie):
curl -H "Cookie: .ROBLOSECURITY=..." \
  "https://assetdelivery.roblox.com/v2/assetId/{placeId}/version/1"
# Download location URL → place_v1.rbxlbin
```

**Binary format parsing:** `.rbxlbin` files contain chunks:
- **INST** — class buckets and referent IDs
- **PROP** — per-instance fields (including `Script.Source`)
- **PRNT** — parent-child relationships (object tree)

Decode chunk payloads, walk PROP entries for `Source` field, dump `Script.Source` / `LocalScript.Source` per version, then diff.

**Key lesson:** Always check version history. Latest version may contain decoy flag while real flag is in an older version. Diff script sources across versions.

## Godot Game Asset Extraction

**Pattern (Steal the Xmas):** Encrypted Godot .pck packages.

**Tools:**
- [gdsdecomp](https://github.com/GDRETools/gdsdecomp) - Extract Godot packages
- [KeyDot](https://github.com/Titoot/KeyDot) - Extract encryption key from Godot executables

**Workflow:**
1. Run KeyDot against game executable → extract encryption key
2. Input key into gdsdecomp
3. Extract and open project in Godot editor
4. Search scripts/resources for flag data

## Rust serde_json Schema Recovery

**Pattern (Curly Crab, PascalCTF 2026):** Rust binary reads JSON from stdin, deserializes via serde_json, prints success/failure emoji.

**Approach:**
1. Disassemble serde-generated `Visitor` implementations
2. Each visitor's `visit_map` / `visit_seq` reveals expected keys and types
3. Look for string literals in deserializer code (field names like `"pascal"`, `"CTF"`)
4. Reconstruct nested JSON schema from visitor call hierarchy
5. Identify value types from visitor method names: `visit_str` = string, `visit_u64` = number, `visit_bool` = boolean, `visit_seq` = array

```json
{"pascal":"CTF","CTF":2026,"crab":{"I_":true,"cr4bs":1337,"crabby":{"l0v3_":["rust"],"r3vv1ng_":42}}}
```

**Key insight:** Flag is the concatenation of JSON keys in schema order. Reading field names in order reveals the flag.

## Verilog/Hardware Reverse Engineering (srdnlenCTF 2026)

**Pattern (Rev Juice):** Verilog HDL source for a vending machine with hidden product unlocked by specific coin insertion and selection sequence.

**Approach:**
1. Analyze Verilog modules to understand state machine and history tracking
2. Identify hidden conditions (e.g., product 8 enabled only when `COINS_HISTORY` array has specific values at specific taps)
3. Build timing model for each action type (how many clock cycles each operation takes)
4. Work backward from required history values to construct the correct input sequence

**Timing model construction:**
```python
# Map each action to its cycle count (determined from Verilog state machines)
TIMING = {
    "insert_coin": 3,       # 3 cycles per coin insertion
    "select_success": 7,    # 7 cycles for successful product selection
    "select_fail": 5,       # 5 cycles for failed selection attempt
    "cancel_with_coins": 4, # 4 cycles for cancel when coins > 0
    "cancel_at_zero": 2,    # 2 cycles for cancel when coins = 0
}

# COINS_HISTORY is a shift register updated each cycle
# History tap requirements (from Verilog conditions):
# H[0]=1, H[7]=4, H[28]=H[33]=H[38]=6
# H[63]=H[73]=2, H[80]=9
# (H[19]+H[21]+H[56]+H[69]) mod 32 = 0
```

**Key insight:** Hardware challenges require understanding the exact timing model — each operation takes a specific number of clock cycles, and shift registers record history at fixed tap positions. Work backward from the required tap values to determine what action must have occurred at each cycle. The solution is often a specific sequence notation (e.g., `I9C_SP6_CNL_I2C_SP2_I6C_SP6_SP6_SP5_CNL_I4C_SP1`).

**Detection:** Look for `.v` or `.sv` (Verilog/SystemVerilog) files, `always @(posedge clk)` blocks, shift register patterns, and state machine `case` statements with hidden conditions gated on history values.

## Prefix-by-Prefix Hash Reversal (Nullcon 2026)

See [patterns.md](patterns.md#prefix-hash-brute-force-nullcon-2026) for the full technique. This section covers language-specific considerations.

**Language-specific notes:**
- Hash algorithm may be uncommon (MD2, custom) — don't need to identify it, just match outputs by running the binary
- Use `subprocess.run()` with `timeout=2` to handle binaries that hang on bad input
- For stripped binaries, check if `ltrace` reveals the hash function name (e.g., `MD2_Update`)
