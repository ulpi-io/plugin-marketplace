## Search() API

The Search API provides a fluent, composable interface for building complex queries. It's more expressive than the basic `query` method and supports advanced features like hybrid search with rank fusion.

**Note:** The Search API is only available on Chroma Cloud and is designed to work with Collection Schemas.

### When to use Search() vs query()

**Use `query()` when:**
- You need simple semantic search
- You're using local Chroma
- You want the most straightforward API

**Use `search()` when:**
- You need hybrid search combining dense and sparse indexes
- You want fine-grained control over ranking and filtering
- You're building complex queries with multiple conditions
- You need to select specific fields to return

Note that the Search() class uses a builder pattern, so if you call a method on it, it does not mutate that instance, it returns a copy with that mutation, so it needs re-assignging to the variable that is referencing it.

The `search()` method on a collection is able to take a single Search class instance or an arry of them, so rhe return value of the `search()` method on a collection is a SearchResult class, which has a `rows()` method, which will give you an array of array of results. So index 0 of the return value of `rows()` will be the array of the first Search class instance results.

### Setup

```python
from chromadb import Search, K, Knn, CloudClient, Rrf
import os

client = CloudClient(
    tenant=os.getenv("CHROMA_TENANT"),
    database=os.getenv("CHROMA_DATABASE"),
    api_key=os.getenv("CHROMA_API_KEY"),
)

collection = client.get_or_create_collection(name="my_collection")
```

### Filtering with Key (K)

The `Key` class (aliased as `K` for brevity) provides a fluent interface for building filter expressions. Think of it like a query builder for metadata, document content, and IDs.

```python
# K is an alias for Key - use K for more concise code
# Filter by metadata field
K("status") == "active"

# Filter by document content
K.DOCUMENT.contains("machine learning")

# Filter by document IDs
K.ID.is_in(["doc1", "doc2", "doc3"])

# Equality and inequality (all types)
K("status") == "published"     # String equality
K("views") != 0                # Numeric inequality
K("featured") == True          # Boolean equality

# Numeric comparisons (numbers only)
K("price") > 100               # Greater than
K("rating") >= 4.5             # Greater than or equal
K("stock") < 10                # Less than
K("discount") <= 0.25          # Less than or equal

# Set membership operators (works on all fields)
K.ID.is_in(["doc1", "doc2", "doc3"])           # Match any ID in list
K("category").is_in(["tech", "science"])       # Match any category
K("status").not_in(["draft", "deleted"])       # Exclude specific values

# String content operators (currently K.DOCUMENT only)
K.DOCUMENT.contains("machine learning")        # Substring search in document
K.DOCUMENT.not_contains("deprecated")          # Exclude documents with text
K.DOCUMENT.regex(r"\bAPI\b")                   # Match whole word "API" in document
```

### Ranking with Knn

`Knn` (k-nearest neighbors) is how you specify which embeddings to search and how to score results. Each `Knn` finds the nearest neighbors for a given query in a specific index.

The `limit` parameter controls how many candidates each `Knn` considers. A higher limit means more candidates are scored, which can improve recall but increases latency.

```python
# Example 1: Single Knn - scores top 16 documents
rank = Knn(query="machine learning research")
# Only the 16 nearest documents get scored (default limit)

# Example 2: Multiple Knn with default=None
rank = Knn(query="research papers", limit=100) + Knn(query="academic publications", limit=100, key="sparse_embedding")
# Both Knn have default=None (the default)
# Documents must appear in BOTH top-100 lists to be scored
# Documents in only one list are excluded

# Example 3: Mixed default values
rank = Knn(query="AI research", limit=100) * 0.5 + Knn(query="scientific papers", limit=50, default=1000.0, key="sparse_embedding") * 0.5
# First Knn has default=None, second has default=1000.0
# Documents in first top-100 but not in second top-50:
#   - Get first distance * 0.5 + 1000.0 * 0.5 (second's default)
# Documents in second top-50 but not in first top-100:
#   - Excluded (must appear in all Knn where default=None)
# Documents in both lists:
#   - Get first distance * 0.5 + second distance * 0.5


from chromadb import Knn

# Basic search on default embedding field
Knn(query="What is machine learning?")

# Search with custom parameters
Knn(
    query="What is machine learning?",
    key="#embedding",      # Field to search (default: "#embedding")
    limit=100,            # Max candidates to consider (default: 16)
    return_rank=False     # Return rank position vs distance (default: False)
)

# Search custom sparse embedding field in metadata
Knn(query="machine learning", key="sparse_embedding")
```

### Basic search example

Here's a complete example showing the typical flow: create a collection, add documents, and search.

```python
# Build the base search with filtering
search = (
    Search()
    .where(K("category") == "science")
    .limit(10)
    .select(K.DOCUMENT, K.SCORE)
)

# Option 1: Pass pre-computed embeddings directly
query_embedding = [0.25, -0.15, 0.33, ...]
result = collection.search(search.rank(Knn(query=query_embedding)))

# Option 2: Pass text query (embedding created using collection's schema configuration)
query_text = "What are the latest advances in quantum computing?"
result = collection.search(search.rank(Knn(query=query_text)))
```

### Hybrid search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)

Hybrid search combines results from multiple indexes (typically dense + sparse) to get better results than either alone. RRF is a rank fusion algorithm that merges ranked lists without needing score normalization.

**How RRF works:**
1. Each `Knn` produces a ranked list of candidates
2. Documents are scored based on their rank position in each list: `1 / (k + rank)`
3. Scores are weighted and summed across all lists
4. Final results are sorted by combined score

The `k` parameter (default 60) controls how much weight top-ranked documents get relative to lower-ranked ones. Higher `k` values make rankings more uniform.

```python
# Dense semantic embeddings
dense_rank = Knn(
    query="machine learning research",  # Text query for dense embeddings
    key="#embedding",          # Default embedding field
    return_rank=True,
    limit=200                  # Consider top 200 candidates
)

# Sparse keyword embeddings
sparse_rank = Knn(
    query="machine learning research",  # Text query for sparse embeddings
    key="sparse_embedding",    # Metadata field for sparse vectors
    return_rank=True,
    limit=200
)

# Combine with RRF
hybrid_rank = Rrf(
    ranks=[dense_rank, sparse_rank],
    weights=[0.7, 0.3],       # 70% semantic, 30% keyword
    k=60
)

# Use in search
search = (Search()
    .where(K("status") == "published")  # Optional filtering
    .rank(hybrid_rank)
    .limit(20)
    .select(K.DOCUMENT, K.SCORE, "title")
)

results = collection.search(search)
```

### Building effective hybrid search

For best results with hybrid search:

1. **Use comparable limits** for each `Knn` so both indexes contribute meaningfully
2. **Weight based on your data**: keyword-heavy content might favor sparse; conceptual content might favor dense
3. **Start with 0.7/0.3 weighting** (dense/sparse) and adjust based on evaluation
4. **Use `returnRank: true`** when combining with RRF, as RRF operates on ranks, not distances

Note that return ranks from RRF are netagive and the value furthest from 0 is the closest to the original query.
