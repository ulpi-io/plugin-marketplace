# Tier Examples

Worked examples showing exact price levels for LONG and SHORT positions.

## LONG Example (10x leverage, entry $28.87, 1890 sz)


| Trigger | Locks | Per-tier retrace | Price triggers at | Floor locks at | Protects |
| ------- | ----- | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| 10%     | 5%    | (global)         | $29.16            | $29.01         | ~$273    |
| 20%     | 14%   | (global)         | $29.45            | $29.27         | ~$764    |
| 30%     | 22%   | 1.2%             | $29.74            | $29.51         | ~$1,201  |
| 50%     | 40%   | 1.0%             | $30.31            | $30.02         | ~$2,183  |
| 75%     | 60%   | 0.8%             | $31.04            | $30.60         | ~$3,274  |
| 100%    | 80%   | 0.6%             | $31.76            | $31.18         | ~$4,366  |


**Trigger price formula (LONG):** `entry × (1 + triggerPct / 100 / leverage)`

- Tier 1: `28.87 × (1 + 10 / 100 / 10)` = `28.87 × 1.01` = $29.16

**Floor price formula (LONG):** `entry + (hw − entry) × lockPct / 100` (lockPct = fraction of entry→hw range to lock)

- Tier 1 (hw at trigger): e.g. `28.87 + (29.16 − 28.87) × 5 / 100` ≈ $28.88 (hw is high water when tier triggers)

**Protected profit:** `(floor - entry) × size`

- Tier 1: `(29.01 - 28.87) × 1890` = ~$273

## SHORT Example (7x leverage, entry $1,955, 3.58 sz)


| Trigger | Locks | Price triggers at | Floor locks at | Protects |
| ------- | ----- | ----------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| 10%     | 5%    | $1,927            | $1,941         | ~$50     |
| 20%     | 14%   | $1,899            | $1,916         | ~$140    |
| 30%     | 22%   | $1,871            | $1,894         | ~$219    |


**Trigger price formula (SHORT):** `entry × (1 - triggerPct / 100 / leverage)`

- Tier 1: `1955 × (1 - 10 / 100 / 7)` = `1955 × 0.9857` = $1,927

**Floor price formula (SHORT):** `entry − (entry − hw) × lockPct / 100`

- Tier 1 (hw = 1927 at trigger): `1955 − (1955 − 1927) × 5 / 100` = 1955 − 1.4 = $1,953.60 (example; actual hw at trigger may differ)

**Protected profit (SHORT):** `(entry - floor) × size`

- Tier 1: `(1955 - 1941) × 3.58` = ~$50

## Key Concepts

- **Trigger > Lock gap**: The difference between trigger and lock gives breathing room. The floor locks lockPct% of the move from entry to high water (e.g. 5% = lock in 5% of that range). This prevents immediate closure from a minor pullback after hitting a tier.
- **Ratchets never go down**: Once Tier 2 is hit, Tier 1's floor is permanently superseded. The floor can only go up (LONG) or down (SHORT).
- **ROE calculation**: `upnl_pct = (upnl / margin) × 100` where `margin = entry × size / leverage`. This means tier triggers automatically account for leverage.
