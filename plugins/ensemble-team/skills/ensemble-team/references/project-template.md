## Development Mandates

These are non-negotiable practices for the project:

- **Test-Driven Development**: Every feature is built using strict TDD.
  No production code without a failing test. When the `tdd` skill is
  installed, the team uses it in automated mode for build-phase work.
- **Mob/Ensemble Programming**: All production code is written by the mob. No solo
  commits to production code.
- **Consensus Decision-Making**: The team operates by consensus. No single technical
  lead or decision-maker. If consensus is not reached after 10 rounds of substantive
  discussion, the decision is escalated to the project owner for a final call.
- **Driver-Reviewer Mob Model**: At most one agent (the Driver) may modify files at
  any time. The remaining agents participate as Reviewers via read-only access and
  messaging. All team members must reach consensus before a task is considered complete.
- **Code Quality Gates**: {{quality_gate_description}}
