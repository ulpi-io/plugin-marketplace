# /evolve — Goal-Driven Compounding Loop

> Measure what's wrong. Fix the worst thing. Measure again. Compound.

Always-on autonomous loop over `/rpi`. Work selection order:
0. **Pinned work queue** (`--queue=<file>` or inline roadmap — see `references/pinned-queue.md`)
1. **Harvested `.agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl` work** (freshest concrete follow-up)
2. **Open ready beads work** (`bd ready`)
3. **Failing goals and directive gaps** (`ao goals measure`)
4. **Testing improvements** (missing/thin coverage, missing regression tests)
5. **Validation tightening and bug-hunt passes** (gates, audits, bug sweeps)
6. **Complexity / TODO / FIXME / drift / dead code / stale docs / stale research mining**
7. **Concrete feature suggestions** derived from repo purpose when no sharper work exists

**Dormancy is last resort.** Empty current queues mean "run the generator layers", not "stop". Only go dormant after the queue layers and generator layers come up empty across multiple consecutive passes.

```bash
/evolve                      # Run until kill switch, max-cycles, or real dormancy
/evolve --max-cycles=5       # Cap at 5 cycles
/evolve --dry-run            # Show what would be worked on, don't execute
/evolve --beads-only         # Skip goals measurement, work beads backlog only
/evolve --quality            # Quality-first mode: prioritize post-mortem findings
/evolve --quality --max-cycles=10  # Quality mode with cycle cap
/evolve --athena             # Mine → Defrag warmup before first cycle
/evolve --athena --max-cycles=5  # Warm knowledge base then run 5 cycles
/evolve --test-first         # Default strict-quality /rpi execution path
/evolve --no-test-first      # Explicit opt-out from test-first mode
/evolve --queue=.agents/evolve/roadmap.md           # Process ordered roadmap
/evolve --queue=.agents/evolve/roadmap.md --test-first  # Roadmap with strict quality
```

| `--no-test-first` | off | Explicitly disable test-first passthrough to `/rpi` |
| `--queue=<file>` | none | Process items from ordered markdown queue file sequentially before fitness-driven selection |

## Execution Steps

**YOU MUST EXECUTE THIS WORKFLOW. Do not just describe it.**

### Step 0: Setup

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/evolve
ao lookup --query "autonomous improvement cycle" --limit 5 2>/dev/null || true
```

Before cycle recovery, load the repo execution profile contract when it exists. The repo execution profile is the source for repo policy; the user prompt should mostly supply mission/objective, not restate startup reads, validation bundle, tracker wrapper rules, or `definition_of_done`.

- Locate `docs/contracts/repo-execution-profile.md` and `docs/contracts/repo-execution-profile.schema.json`.
- Read the ordered `startup_reads` and bootstrap from those repo paths before selecting work.
- Cache repo `validation_commands`, `tracker_commands`, and `definition_of_done` into session state.
- If the repo execution profile is present but missing required fields, stop or downgrade with an explicit warning before cycle 1. Do not silently invent repo policy.

Recover cycle number, queue/generator streaks, and the last claimed work item from disk (survives context compaction):
```bash
if [ -f .agents/evolve/cycle-history.jsonl ]; then
  CYCLE=$(( $(tail -1 .agents/evolve/cycle-history.jsonl | jq -r '.cycle // 0') + 1 ))
else
  CYCLE=1
fi
SESSION_START_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

# Recover idle streak from disk (not in-memory — survives compaction)
# Portable: forward-scanning awk counts trailing idle run without tac (unavailable on stock macOS)
IDLE_STREAK=$(awk '/"result"\s*:\s*"(idle|unchanged)"/{streak++; next} {streak=0} END{print streak+0}' \
  .agents/evolve/cycle-history.jsonl 2>/dev/null)

PRODUCTIVE_THIS_SESSION=0

# Recover generator state and queue claim state
if [ -f .agents/evolve/session-state.json ]; then
  GENERATOR_EMPTY_STREAK=$(jq -r '.generator_empty_streak // 0' .agents/evolve/session-state.json 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
  LAST_SELECTED_SOURCE=$(jq -r '.last_selected_source // empty' .agents/evolve/session-state.json 2>/dev/null || true)
  CLAIMED_WORK_REF=$(jq -r '.claimed_work.ref // empty' .agents/evolve/session-state.json 2>/dev/null || true)
else
  GENERATOR_EMPTY_STREAK=0
  LAST_SELECTED_SOURCE=""
  CLAIMED_WORK_REF=""
fi

# Circuit breaker: stop if last productive cycle was >60 minutes ago
LAST_PRODUCTIVE_TS=$(grep -v '"idle"\|"unchanged"' .agents/evolve/cycle-history.jsonl 2>/dev/null \
  | tail -1 | jq -r '.timestamp // empty')
# Consecutive failure breaker (pinned queue mode)
if [ -n "$QUEUE_FILE" ]; then
  CONSEC_FAILURES=$(awk '/"result"\s*:\s*"(regressed|unchanged)"/{streak++; next} {streak=0} END{print streak+0}' \
    .agents/evolve/cycle-history.jsonl 2>/dev/null)
  if [ "$CONSEC_FAILURES" -ge 5 ]; then
    echo "CIRCUIT BREAKER: 5 consecutive failures in pinned queue mode. Stopping."
    # go to Teardown
  fi
fi

# Time-based circuit breaker: skip when pinned queue has items remaining
if [ -z "$QUEUE_FILE" ] || [ "$QUEUE_INDEX" -ge "$QUEUE_TOTAL" ]; then
  if [ -n "$LAST_PRODUCTIVE_TS" ]; then
    NOW_EPOCH=$(date +%s)
    LAST_EPOCH=$(date -j -f "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z" "$LAST_PRODUCTIVE_TS" +%s 2>/dev/null \
      || date -d "$LAST_PRODUCTIVE_TS" +%s 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
    if [ "$LAST_EPOCH" -gt 1000000000 ] && [ $((NOW_EPOCH - LAST_EPOCH)) -ge 3600 ]; then
      echo "CIRCUIT BREAKER: No productive work in 60+ minutes. Stopping."
      # go to Teardown
    fi
  fi
fi

# Track oscillating goals (improved→fail→improved→fail) to avoid burning cycles
declare -A QUARANTINED_GOALS  # goal_id → true if oscillation count >= 3

# Pre-populate quarantine list from cycle history (lightweight local scan)
if [ -f .agents/evolve/cycle-history.jsonl ]; then
  while IFS= read -r goal; do
    QUARANTINED_GOALS[$goal]=true
    echo "Quarantined oscillating goal: $goal"
  done < <(
    jq -r '.target' .agents/evolve/cycle-history.jsonl 2>/dev/null \
    | awk '{
        if (prev != "" && prev != $0) transitions[$0]++
        prev = $0
      }
      END {
        for (g in transitions) if (transitions[g] >= 3) print g
      }'
  )
fi
```

Parse flags: `--max-cycles=N` (default unlimited), `--dry-run`, `--beads-only`, `--skip-baseline`, `--quality`, `--athena`, `--queue=<file>`.

### Step 0.1: Parse Pinned Queue (--queue only)

Skip if `--queue` was not passed.

If the `--queue` value is not a file path (file does not exist), auto-write the value to `.agents/evolve/roadmap.md` and use that file. This enables inline/prompt-based roadmaps.

Parse the queue file as an ordered markdown checklist:

```bash
if [ -n "$QUEUE_FILE" ] && [ -f "$QUEUE_FILE" ]; then
  QUEUE_ITEMS=()
  declare -A QUEUE_BLOCKERS
  declare -A QUEUE_LINES  # preserve full line per item ID for freeform prompts
  while IFS= read -r line; do
    ITEM_ID=$(echo "$line" | sed -n 's/.*`\([^`]*\)`.*/\1/p' | head -1)
    BLOCKER=$(echo "$line" | sed -n 's/.*blocker:[[:space:]]*`\([^`]*\)`.*/\1/p')
    if [ -n "$ITEM_ID" ]; then
      QUEUE_ITEMS+=("$ITEM_ID")
      QUEUE_LINES["$ITEM_ID"]="$line"
    fi
    [ -n "$BLOCKER" ] && QUEUE_BLOCKERS["$ITEM_ID"]="$BLOCKER"
  done < <(grep -E '^\s*[0-9]+\.' "$QUEUE_FILE")
  QUEUE_TOTAL=${#QUEUE_ITEMS[@]}
fi

# Initialize tracking arrays
PINNED_COMPLETED=()
PINNED_ESCALATED='[]'

# Resume from persisted state
if [ -f .agents/evolve/pinned-queue-state.json ]; then
  QUEUE_INDEX=$(jq -r '.current_index // 0' .agents/evolve/pinned-queue-state.json)
  # Restore completed items array
  mapfile -t PINNED_COMPLETED < <(jq -r '.completed[]? // empty' .agents/evolve/pinned-queue-state.json 2>/dev/null)
  # Load escalated items (both IDs for skip-check and full JSON for state persistence)
  ESCALATED_IDS=$(jq -r '.escalated[]?.id // empty' .agents/evolve/pinned-queue-state.json 2>/dev/null)
  PINNED_ESCALATED=$(jq -c '.escalated // []' .agents/evolve/pinned-queue-state.json 2>/dev/null)
else
  QUEUE_INDEX=0
fi
```

See `references/pinned-queue.md` for format specification, blocker syntax, and state schema.

Track cycle-level execution state:

```text
evolve_state = {
  cycle: <current cycle number>,
  mode: <standard|quality|beads-only>,
  test_first: <true by default; false only when --no-test-first>,
  repo_profile_path: <docs/contracts/repo-execution-profile.md or null>,
  startup_reads: <ordered repo bootstrap paths>,
  validation_commands: <ordered repo validation bundle>,
  tracker_commands: <repo tracker shell wrappers>,
  definition_of_done: <repo stop predicates>,
  generator_empty_streak: <consecutive passes where all generator layers returned nothing>,
  last_selected_source: <harvested|beads|goal|directive|testing|validation|bug-hunt|drift|feature>,
  claimed_work: <null or queue reference being worked>,
  queue_refresh_count: <incremented after every /rpi cycle>,
  pinned_queue: <parsed items array or null>,
  pinned_queue_file: <path or null>,
  pinned_queue_index: <current 0-based position>,
  pinned_queue_completed: <array of completed item IDs>,
  pinned_queue_escalated: <array of escalated items with reasons>,
  unblock_depth: <current nesting depth, 0 when not unblocking>,
  unblock_failures: <consecutive failures on current item>,
  unblock_chain: <stack of blocker IDs being resolved>
}
```

Persist `evolve_state` to `.agents/evolve/session-state.json` at each cycle boundary, after queue claims, after queue release/finalize, and during teardown. `cycle-history.jsonl` remains the canonical cycle ledger; `session-state.json` carries resume-only state that has not yet earned a committed cycle entry.

### Step 0.2: Athena Warmup (--athena only)

Skip if `--athena` was not passed or if `--dry-run`.

Run the mechanical half of the Athena cycle to surface fresh signal before the first evolve cycle:

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/mine .agents/defrag
echo "Athena warmup: mining signal..."
ao mine --since 26h --quiet 2>/dev/null || echo "(ao mine unavailable — skipping)"

echo "Athena warmup: defrag sweep..."
ao defrag --prune --dedup --quiet 2>/dev/null || echo "(ao defrag unavailable — skipping)"
```

Then read `.agents/mine/latest.json` and `.agents/defrag/latest.json` and note (in 1-2 sentences each):
- Any **orphaned research** files that look relevant to current goals
- Any **code hotspots** (high-CC functions with recent edits) that may be the root cause of failing goals
- Any **duplicate learnings** merged by defrag — context on what's been cleaned up

These notes inform work selection throughout the evolve session. Store them in a session variable (in-memory), not a file.

### Step 0.5: Baseline (first run only)

Skip if `--skip-baseline` or `--beads-only` or baseline already exists.

```bash
if [ ! -f .agents/evolve/fitness-0-baseline.json ]; then
  bash scripts/evolve-capture-baseline.sh \
    --label "era-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)" \
    --timeout 60
fi
```

### Step 1: Kill Switch Check

Run at the TOP of every cycle:

```bash
CYCLE_START_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
[ -f ~/.config/evolve/KILL ] && echo "KILL: $(cat ~/.config/evolve/KILL)" && exit 0
[ -f .agents/evolve/STOP ] && echo "STOP: $(cat .agents/evolve/STOP 2>/dev/null)" && exit 0
```

### Step 2: Measure Fitness

Skip if `--beads-only`.

```bash
bash scripts/evolve-measure-fitness.sh \
  --output .agents/evolve/fitness-latest.json \
  --timeout 60 \
  --total-timeout 75
```

**Do NOT write per-cycle `fitness-{N}-pre.json` files.** The rolling file is sufficient for work selection and regression detection.

This writes a fitness snapshot to `.agents/evolve/` atomically via a temp file plus JSON validation. The AgentOps CLI is required for fitness measurement because the wrapper shells out to `ao goals measure`. If measurement exceeds the whole-command bound or returns invalid JSON, the wrapper fails without clobbering the previous rolling snapshot.

### Step 3: Select Work

Selection is a ladder, not a one-shot check. After every productive cycle, return to the TOP of this step and re-read the queue before considering dormancy.

**Step 3.0: Pinned work queue** (only when `--queue` is set)

If a pinned queue exists and `QUEUE_INDEX < QUEUE_TOTAL`:

1. Read the current item and set tracking variables:
   ```bash
   CURRENT_ITEM=${QUEUE_ITEMS[$QUEUE_INDEX]}
   CURRENT_LINE=${QUEUE_LINES[$CURRENT_ITEM]}
   ```
2. Skip if this item ID is in the escalated list (log skip reason, advance index, re-enter Step 3.0)
3. Check for declared blocker: `QUEUE_BLOCKERS[$CURRENT_ITEM]`
4. If blocker exists AND blocker is not yet resolved (not in `pinned_queue_completed`):
   - Set `UNBLOCK_TARGET` to the blocker
   - Set `UNBLOCK_DEPTH=0` (increments before each deeper nesting)
   - Proceed to Step 4 with the blocker as the work item
5. If no blocker (or blocker already resolved):
   - Proceed to Step 4 with the queue item as the work item

**Item-to-prompt mapping:**
- If item ID matches a bead (`bd show $CURRENT_ITEM` succeeds), use: `/rpi "Land $CURRENT_ITEM: $(bd show $CURRENT_ITEM --json | jq -r .title)" --auto --max-cycles=1`
- Otherwise, use the preserved full queue line: `/rpi "${QUEUE_LINES[$CURRENT_ITEM]}" --auto --max-cycles=1`

**Escalation cascade guard:** When an item is escalated (skipped), check if subsequent items declare the escalated item as a `blocker:`. If so, those dependent items are also marked escalated. This prevents attempting work that depends on a skipped item.

When pinned queue is active, skip Steps 3.1-3.7 (and 3.0q-3.6q in quality mode) entirely. The queue IS the work source. `--quality` in pinned queue mode affects `/rpi` invocations (via `--quality` passthrough) but does not change the work selection ladder — the queue always takes priority.

When pinned queue is exhausted (`QUEUE_INDEX >= QUEUE_TOTAL`):
- Fall through to normal selection (Steps 3.1-3.7)
- This enables fitness-driven work after roadmap completion

**Step 3.1: Harvested work first**

Read `.agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl` and pick the highest-value unconsumed item for this repo. Prefer:
- exact repo match before `*`, then legacy unscoped entries
- already-harvested concrete implementation work before process work
- higher severity before lower severity

When evolve picks a queue item, **claim it first**:
- set `claim_status: "in_progress"`
- set `claimed_by: "evolve:cycle-N"`
- set `claimed_at: "<timestamp>"`
- keep `consumed: false` until the `/rpi` cycle and regression gate both succeed

If the cycle fails, regresses, or is interrupted before success, release the claim and leave the item available for the next cycle.

**Step 3.2: Open ready beads**

If no harvested item is ready, check `bd ready`. Pick the highest-priority unblocked issue.

**Step 3.3: Failing goals and directive gaps** (skip if `--beads-only`)

First assess directives, then goals:
- top-priority directive gap from `ao goals measure --directives`
- highest-weight failing goals (skip quarantined oscillators)
- lower-weight failing goals

This step exists even when all queued work is empty. Goals are the third source, not the stop condition.

```bash
DIRECTIVES=$(ao goals measure --directives 2>/dev/null)
FAILING=$(jq -r '.goals[] | select(.result=="fail") | .id' .agents/evolve/fitness-latest.json | head -1)
```

**Oscillation check:** Before working a failing goal, check if it has oscillated (improved→fail transitions ≥ 3 times in cycle-history.jsonl). If so, quarantine it and try the next failing goal. See `references/oscillation.md`.
```bash
# Count improved→fail transitions for this goal
OSC_COUNT=$(jq -r "select(.target==\"$FAILING\") | .result" .agents/evolve/cycle-history.jsonl \
  | awk 'prev=="improved" && $0=="fail" {count++} {prev=$0} END {print count+0}')
if [ "$OSC_COUNT" -ge 3 ]; then
  QUARANTINED_GOALS[$FAILING]=true
  echo "{\"cycle\":${CYCLE},\"target\":\"${FAILING}\",\"result\":\"quarantined\",\"oscillations\":${OSC_COUNT},\"timestamp\":\"$(date -Iseconds)\"}" >> .agents/evolve/cycle-history.jsonl
fi
```

**Step 3.4: Testing improvements**

When queues and goals are empty, generate concrete testing work instead of idling:
- find packages/files with thin or missing tests
- look for missing regression tests around recent bug-fix paths
- identify flaky or absent headless/runtime smokes

Convert any real finding into durable work:
- add a bead when the work needs tracked backlog ownership, or
- append a queue item under the shared next-work contract when it should flow directly back into `/rpi`

**Step 3.5: Validation tightening and bug-hunt passes**

If testing improvement generation returns nothing, run bug-hunt and validation sweeps:
- missing validation gates
- weak lint/contract coverage
- bug-hunt style audits for risky areas
- stale assumptions between docs, contracts, and runtime truth

Again: convert findings into beads or queue items, then immediately select the highest-priority result and continue.

**Step 3.6: Drift / hotspot / dead-code mining**

If the prior generators are empty, mine for:
- complexity hotspots
- stale TODO/FIXME markers
- dead code
- stale docs
- stale research
- drift between generated artifacts and source-of-truth files

Do not stop here. Normalize findings into tracked work and continue.

**Step 3.7: Feature suggestions**

If all concrete remediation layers are empty, propose one or more specific feature ideas grounded in the repo purpose, write them as durable work, and continue:
- create a bead when the feature needs review/backlog treatment
- or append a queue item with `source: "feature-suggestion"` when it is ready for the next `/rpi` cycle

**Quality mode (`--quality`)** — inverted cascade (findings before directives):

Step 3.0q: Unconsumed high-severity post-mortem findings:
```bash
HIGH=$(jq -r 'select(.consumed==false) | .items[] | select(.severity=="high") | .title' \
  .agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl 2>/dev/null | head -1)
```

Step 3.1q: Unconsumed medium-severity findings.

Step 3.2q: Open ready beads.

Step 3.3q: Emergency gates (weight >= 5) and top directive gaps.

Step 3.4q: Testing improvements.

Step 3.5q: Validation tightening / bug-hunt / drift mining.

Step 3.6q: Feature suggestions.

This inverts the standard cascade only at the top of the ladder: findings BEFORE goals and directives. It does NOT skip the generator layers.

When evolve picks a finding, claim it first in next-work.jsonl:
- Set `claim_status: "in_progress"`, `claimed_by: "evolve-quality:cycle-N"`, `claimed_at: "<timestamp>"`
- Set `consumed: true` only after the /rpi cycle and regression gate succeed
- If the /rpi cycle fails (regression), clear the claim and leave `consumed: false`

See `references/quality-mode.md` for scoring and full details.

**Nothing found?** HARD GATE — only consider dormancy after the generator layers also came up empty:

```bash
# Count trailing idle/unchanged entries in cycle-history.jsonl (portable, no tac)
IDLE_STREAK=$(awk '/"result"\s*:\s*"(idle|unchanged)"/{streak++; next} {streak=0} END{print streak+0}' \
  .agents/evolve/cycle-history.jsonl 2>/dev/null)

# Pinned queue mode: never consider stagnation while queue has items
if [ -n "$QUEUE_FILE" ] && [ "$QUEUE_INDEX" -lt "$QUEUE_TOTAL" ]; then
  # Queue not exhausted — skip stagnation check, return to Step 3.0
  :
elif [ "$GENERATOR_EMPTY_STREAK" -ge 2 ] && [ "$IDLE_STREAK" -ge 2 ]; then
  # Queue layers are empty AND producer layers were empty for the 3rd consecutive pass — STOP
  echo "Stagnation reached after repeated empty queue + generator passes. Dormancy is the last-resort outcome."
  # go to Teardown — do NOT log another idle entry
fi
```

If the queue layers were empty but a generator pass has not been exhausted 3 times yet, persist the new generator streak in `session-state.json` and loop back to Step 1. Empty pre-cycle queues are not a stop reason by themselves.

A cycle is idle only if NO work source returned actionable work and every generator layer also came up empty. A cycle that targeted an oscillating goal and skipped it counts as idle only after the remaining ladder was exhausted.

If `--dry-run`: report what would be worked on and go to Teardown.

### Step 4: Execute

**4.1: Blocker Resolution (pinned queue only)**

If `UNBLOCK_TARGET` is set (from Step 3.0), enter the blocker resolution sub-loop:

```text
unblock_loop:
  if UNBLOCK_DEPTH > 2:
    ESCALATE: "Blocker chain too deep (>2 levels). Item: $ITEM_ID, chain: $UNBLOCK_CHAIN"
    Write escalation to .agents/evolve/escalated.md (item, reason, cycle, chain)
    Mark item as escalated in pinned-queue-state.json
    Run escalation cascade: check if subsequent queue items declare this item as blocker
    Advance QUEUE_INDEX to next non-escalated item
    Return to Step 3

  Run: /rpi "Unblock: land $UNBLOCK_TARGET as minimum unblocker" --auto --max-cycles=1

  if unblock succeeded:
    Close/update blocker bead if applicable (bd close $UNBLOCK_TARGET)
    Add UNBLOCK_TARGET to pinned_queue_completed
    Clear UNBLOCK_TARGET, reset UNBLOCK_DEPTH to 0
    UNBLOCK_FAILURES=0
    Persist queue state (atomic write)
    Return to Step 3.0 to re-check the original item (blocker now resolved)

  if unblock failed:
    UNBLOCK_FAILURES++
    if UNBLOCK_FAILURES >= 3:
      ESCALATE: "3 consecutive unblock failures on $UNBLOCK_TARGET"
      Write escalation to .agents/evolve/escalated.md
      Mark item as escalated in pinned-queue-state.json
      Run escalation cascade for dependent items
      Advance QUEUE_INDEX to next non-escalated item
      Return to Step 3

    Dynamic blocker detection — scan /rpi failure output for:
      - bead IDs mentioned in error context (bd show $ID succeeds)
      - dependency keywords ("blocked by", "requires", "depends on")
      - import/build failures pointing to missing prerequisites
    if deeper_blocker found AND UNBLOCK_DEPTH < 2:
      UNBLOCK_DEPTH++
      Push current UNBLOCK_TARGET to UNBLOCK_CHAIN
      Set UNBLOCK_TARGET = deeper_blocker
      goto unblock_loop
    else:
      Retry with narrowed scope: /rpi "Unblock $UNBLOCK_TARGET" --auto --max-cycles=1 --quality
      (--quality forces pre-mortem on the unblock attempt for better diagnosis)
      goto unblock_loop
```

Kill switch is checked at the top of EVERY sub-`/rpi` invocation (inherited from `/rpi`'s own kill switch check). See `references/pinned-queue.md` for full protocol details.

**4.2: Normal Execution**

Primary engine: use `/rpi` for any implementation-quality work. `/implement` and `/crank` are allowed only when a bead already contains execution-ready scope and skipping discovery is clearly the better path.

For a **harvested item, failing goal, directive gap, testing improvement, validation tightening task, bug-hunt result, drift finding, or feature suggestion**:
```
Invoke /rpi "{normalized work title}" --auto --max-cycles=1
```

For a **beads issue**:
```
Prefer: /rpi "Land {issue_id}: {title}" --auto --max-cycles=1
Fallback: /implement {issue_id}
```
Or for an epic with children: `Invoke /crank {epic_id}`.

If Step 3 created durable work instead of executing it immediately, re-enter Step 3 and let the newly-created queue/bead item win through the normal selection order.

### Step 5: Regression Gate

After execution, verify nothing broke:

```bash
# Detect and run project build+test
if [ -f Makefile ]; then make test
elif [ -f package.json ]; then npm test
elif [ -f go.mod ]; then go build ./... && go vet ./... && go test ./... -count=1 -timeout 120s
elif [ -f Cargo.toml ]; then cargo build && cargo test
elif [ -f pyproject.toml ] || [ -f setup.py ]; then python -m pytest
else echo "No recognized build system found"; fi

# Cross-cutting constraint check (catches wiring regressions)
if [ -f scripts/check-wiring-closure.sh ]; then
  bash scripts/check-wiring-closure.sh
else
  echo "WARNING: scripts/check-wiring-closure.sh not found — skipping wiring check"
fi
```

If not `--beads-only`, also re-measure to produce a post-cycle snapshot:
```bash
bash scripts/evolve-measure-fitness.sh \
  --output .agents/evolve/fitness-latest-post.json \
  --timeout 60 \
  --total-timeout 75 \
  --goal "$GOAL_ID"

# Extract goal counts for cycle history entry
PASSING=$(jq '[.goals[] | select(.result=="pass")] | length' .agents/evolve/fitness-latest-post.json 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
TOTAL=$(jq '.goals | length' .agents/evolve/fitness-latest-post.json 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
```

**If regression detected** (previously-passing goal now fails):
```bash
git revert HEAD --no-edit  # single commit
# or for multiple commits:
git revert --no-commit ${CYCLE_START_SHA}..HEAD && git commit -m "revert: evolve cycle ${CYCLE} regression"
```
Set outcome to "regressed".

Queue finalization after the regression gate:
- **success:** finalize any claimed queue item with `consumed: true`, `consumed_by`, and `consumed_at`; clear transient claim fields
- **failure/regression:** clear `claim_status`, `claimed_by`, and `claimed_at`; keep `consumed: false`; record the release in `session-state.json`

After the cycle's `/post-mortem` finishes, immediately re-read `.agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl` before selecting the next item. Never assume the queue state from before the cycle.

### Step 6: Log Cycle + Commit

Two paths: productive cycles get committed, idle cycles are local-only.

**PRODUCTIVE cycles** (result is improved, regressed, or harvested):

```bash
# Quality mode: compute quality_score BEFORE writing the JSONL entry
QUALITY_SCORE_ARGS=()
if [ "$QUALITY_MODE" = "true" ]; then
  REMAINING_HIGH=$(jq -r 'select(.consumed==false) | .items[] | select(.severity=="high")' \
    .agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
  REMAINING_MEDIUM=$(jq -r 'select(.consumed==false) | .items[] | select(.severity=="medium")' \
    .agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
  QUALITY_SCORE=$((100 - (REMAINING_HIGH * 10) - (REMAINING_MEDIUM * 3)))
  [ "$QUALITY_SCORE" -lt 0 ] && QUALITY_SCORE=0
  QUALITY_SCORE_ARGS=(--quality-score "$QUALITY_SCORE")
fi

# Pinned queue fields (appended to cycle entry when active)
QUEUE_ARGS=()
if [ -n "$QUEUE_FILE" ]; then
  QUEUE_ARGS=(--queue-item "${CURRENT_ITEM:-}" --queue-index "$QUEUE_INDEX" --queue-total "$QUEUE_TOTAL")
  [ -n "$UNBLOCK_TARGET" ] && QUEUE_ARGS+=(--unblock-target "$UNBLOCK_TARGET" --unblock-depth "$UNBLOCK_DEPTH")
fi

ENTRY_JSON="$(
  bash scripts/evolve-log-cycle.sh \
    --cycle "$CYCLE" \
    --target "$TARGET" \
    --result "$OUTCOME" \
    --canonical-sha "$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)" \
    --cycle-start-sha "$CYCLE_START_SHA" \
    --goals-passing "$PASSING" \
    --goals-total "$TOTAL" \
    "${QUALITY_SCORE_ARGS[@]}" \
    "${QUEUE_ARGS[@]}"
)"
OUTCOME="$(printf '%s\n' "$ENTRY_JSON" | jq -r '.result')"
REAL_CHANGES=$(git diff --name-only "${CYCLE_START_SHA}..HEAD" -- ':!.agents/**' ':!GOALS.yaml' ':!GOALS.md' \
  2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')

# Telemetry
bash scripts/log-telemetry.sh evolve cycle-complete cycle=${CYCLE} goal=${TARGET} outcome=${OUTCOME} 2>/dev/null || true

if [ "$OUTCOME" = "unchanged" ]; then
  # No-delta cycle: leave local-only so history stays honest and stagnation logic can see it.
  :
elif [ "$REAL_CHANGES" -gt 0 ]; then
  # Full commit: real code was changed
  git add .agents/evolve/cycle-history.jsonl
  git commit -m "evolve: cycle ${CYCLE} -- ${TARGET} ${OUTCOME}"
else
  # Productive cycle with non-agent repo delta already committed by a sub-skill:
  # stage the ledger but do not create a standalone follow-up commit.
  git add .agents/evolve/cycle-history.jsonl
fi

PRODUCTIVE_THIS_SESSION=$((PRODUCTIVE_THIS_SESSION + 1))

# Advance pinned queue after successful cycle (not unblock sub-cycles)
if [ -n "$QUEUE_FILE" ] && [ -z "$UNBLOCK_TARGET" ] && [ "$OUTCOME" != "regressed" ] && [ "$OUTCOME" != "failed" ]; then
  PINNED_COMPLETED+=("$CURRENT_ITEM")
  QUEUE_INDEX=$((QUEUE_INDEX + 1))
  # Persist queue state (atomic write via temp file)
  TMP=$(mktemp .agents/evolve/pinned-queue-state.XXXXXX.json)
  jq -n --arg file "$QUEUE_FILE" --argjson idx "$QUEUE_INDEX" \
    --argjson completed "$(printf '%s\n' "${PINNED_COMPLETED[@]}" | jq -R . | jq -s .)" \
    --argjson escalated "$PINNED_ESCALATED" \
    '{queue_file: $file, current_index: $idx, completed: $completed, in_progress: null, escalated: $escalated, unblock_chain: []}' \
    > "$TMP" && jq . "$TMP" >/dev/null 2>&1 && mv "$TMP" .agents/evolve/pinned-queue-state.json
fi
```

**IDLE cycles** (nothing found even after generator layers):

```bash
bash scripts/evolve-log-cycle.sh \
  --cycle "$CYCLE" \
  --target "idle" \
  --result "unchanged" >/dev/null
# No git add, no git commit, no fitness snapshot write
```

### Step 7: Loop or Stop

```bash
while true; do
  # Step 1 .. Step 6
  # Stop if kill switch, max-cycles, or a real safety breaker triggers
  # Otherwise increment cycle and re-enter selection
  CYCLE=$((CYCLE + 1))
done
```

Push only when productive work has accumulated:
```bash
if [ $((PRODUCTIVE_THIS_SESSION % 5)) -eq 0 ] && [ "$PRODUCTIVE_THIS_SESSION" -gt 0 ]; then
  git push
fi
```

### Teardown

1. Commit any staged but uncommitted cycle-history.jsonl (from artifact-only cycles):
```bash
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q cycle-history.jsonl; then
  git commit -m "evolve: session teardown -- artifact-only cycles logged"
fi
```
2. Run `/post-mortem "evolve session: ${CYCLE} cycles"` to harvest learnings.
3. Push only if unpushed commits exist:
```bash
UNPUSHED=$(git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
[ "$UNPUSHED" -gt 0 ] && git push
```
4. Report summary:

```
## /evolve Complete
Cycles: N | Productive: X | Regressed: Y (reverted) | Idle: Z
Stop reason: stagnation | circuit-breaker | max-cycles | kill-switch
```

In quality mode, the report includes additional fields:
```
## /evolve Complete (quality mode)
Cycles: N | Findings resolved: X | Goals fixed: Y | Idle: Z
Quality score: start → end (delta)
Remaining unconsumed: H high, M medium
Stop reason: stagnation | circuit-breaker | max-cycles | kill-switch
```

In pinned queue mode, the report includes:
```
## /evolve Complete (pinned queue mode)
Queue: X/Y items completed | Unblocked: U items | Escalated: E items
Cycles: N | Productive: P | Regressed: R (reverted)
Stop reason: queue-complete | escalated | circuit-breaker | kill-switch
Remaining items: [list of uncompleted item IDs]
```

## Examples

**User says:** `/evolve --max-cycles=5`
**What happens:** Evolve re-enters the full selection ladder after every `/rpi` cycle and runs producer layers instead of idling on empty queues.

**User says:** `/evolve --beads-only`
**What happens:** Evolve skips goals measurement and works through `bd ready` backlog.

**User says:** `/evolve --dry-run`
**What happens:** Evolve shows what would be worked on without executing.

**User says:** `/evolve --athena`
**What happens:** Evolve runs `ao mine` + `ao defrag` at session start to surface fresh signal (orphaned research, code hotspots, oscillating goals) before the first evolve cycle. Use before a long autonomous run or after a burst of development activity.

**User says:** `/evolve`
**What happens:** See `references/examples.md` for a worked overnight flow that moves through beads -> harvested work -> goals -> testing -> bug hunt -> feature suggestion before dormancy is considered.

**User says:** `/evolve --queue=.agents/evolve/roadmap.md --test-first`
**What happens:** Evolve processes each item in the roadmap sequentially. When an item is blocked (e.g., `rig-difc` blocked by `rig-8z29`), evolve auto-lands `rig-8z29` via sub-`/rpi` first, then resumes `rig-difc`. After all queue items complete, evolve falls through to fitness-driven selection. If a blocker chain exceeds 2 levels or fails 3 times, the item is escalated and evolve moves to the next one.

**User says:** `/evolve --queue=.agents/evolve/roadmap.md --max-cycles=20`
**What happens:** Evolve processes the roadmap but caps at 20 total cycles (including unblock sub-cycles). If the queue isn't finished, queue state is persisted to `.agents/evolve/pinned-queue-state.json` for resume in the next session.

See `references/examples.md` for detailed walkthroughs.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Loop exits immediately | Remove `~/.config/evolve/KILL` or `.agents/evolve/STOP` |
| Stagnation after repeated empty passes | Queue layers and producer layers were empty across multiple passes — dormancy is the fallback outcome |
| `ao goals measure` hangs | Use `--timeout 30` flag or `--beads-only` to skip |
| Regression gate reverts | Review reverted changes, narrow scope, re-run; claimed queue items must be released back to available state |
| Blocker chain too deep (>2 levels) | Reduce blocker dependencies or manually land the deepest blocker before resuming |
| Queue item escalated after 3 failures | Review the item scope, simplify, or manually unblock; check `.agents/evolve/escalated.md` for details |
| Queue state lost after compaction | Recover from `.agents/evolve/pinned-queue-state.json` — evolve auto-loads this on restart |

See `references/cycle-history.md` for advanced troubleshooting.
