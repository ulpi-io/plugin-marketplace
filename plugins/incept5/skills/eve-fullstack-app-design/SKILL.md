# Full-Stack App Design on Eve Horizon

Architect applications where the manifest is the blueprint, the platform handles infrastructure, and every design decision is intentional.

## When to Use

Load this skill when:
- Designing a new application from scratch on Eve
- Migrating an existing app onto the platform
- Evaluating whether your current architecture uses Eve's capabilities well
- Planning service topology, database strategy, or deployment pipelines
- Deciding between managed and external services

This skill teaches *design thinking* for Eve's PaaS layer. For CLI usage and operational detail, load the corresponding eve-se skills (`eve-manifest-authoring`, `eve-deploy-debugging`, `eve-auth-and-secrets`, `eve-pipelines-workflows`).

## The Manifest as Blueprint

The manifest (`.eve/manifest.yaml`) is the single source of truth for your application's shape. Treat it as an architectural document, not just configuration.

### What the Manifest Declares

| Concern | Manifest Section | Design Decision |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Service topology | `services` | What processes run, how they connect |
| Infrastructure | `services[].x-eve` | Managed DB, ingress, roles |
| Build strategy | `services[].build` + `registry` | What gets built, where images live |
| Release pipeline | `pipelines` | How code flows from commit to production |
| Environment shape | `environments` | Which environments exist, what pipelines they use |
| Agent configuration | `x-eve.agents`, `x-eve.chat` | Agent profiles, team dispatch, chat routing |
| Runtime defaults | `x-eve.defaults` | Harness, workspace, git policies |

**Design principle**: If an agent or operator can't understand your app's shape by reading the manifest, the manifest is incomplete.

## Service Topology

### Choose Your Services

Most Eve apps follow one of these patterns:

**API + Database** (simplest):
```
services:
  api:        # HTTP service with ingress
  db:         # managed Postgres
```

**API + Worker + Database**:
```
services:
  api:        # HTTP service (user-facing)
  worker:     # Background processor (jobs, queues)
  db:         # managed Postgres
```

**Multi-Service**:
```
services:
  web:        # Frontend/SSR
  api:        # Backend API
  worker:     # Background jobs
  db:         # managed Postgres
  redis:      # external cache (x-eve.external: true)
```

### Service Design Rules

1. **One concern per service.** Separate HTTP serving from background processing. An API service should not also run scheduled jobs.
2. **Use managed DB for Postgres.** Declare `x-eve.role: managed_db` and let the platform provision, connect, and inject credentials. No manual connection strings.
3. **Mark external services explicitly.** Use `x-eve.external: true` with `x-eve.connection_url` for services hosted outside Eve (Redis, third-party APIs).
4. **Use `x-eve.role: job` for one-off tasks.** Migrations, seeds, and data backfills are job services, not persistent processes.
5. **Expose ingress intentionally.** Only services that need external HTTP access get `x-eve.ingress.public: true`. Internal services communicate via cluster networking.

### App Object Storage

Apps that need to store files (uploads, avatars, exports) can declare object store buckets in the manifest:

```yaml
services:
  api:
    x-eve:
      object_store:
        buckets:
          - name: uploads
            visibility: private
          - name: avatars
            visibility: public
```

> **Note:** The database schema for app object stores exists, but automatic provisioning from the manifest is not yet wired. See `references/object-store-filesystem.md` for current status.

When wired, the platform injects `STORAGE_ENDPOINT`, `STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY`, `STORAGE_SECRET_KEY`, `STORAGE_BUCKET`, and `STORAGE_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` into the service container.

### Platform-Injected Variables

Every deployed service receives `EVE_API_URL`, `EVE_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `EVE_PROJECT_ID`, `EVE_ORG_ID`, and `EVE_ENV_NAME`. Use `EVE_API_URL` for server-to-server calls. Use `EVE_PUBLIC_API_URL` for browser-facing code. Design your app to read these rather than hardcoding URLs.

## Database Design

### Provisioning

Declare a managed database in the manifest:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    x-eve:
      role: managed_db
      managed:
        class: db.p1
        engine: postgres
        engine_version: "16"
```

Reference the connection URL in other services: `${managed.db.url}`.

### Schema Strategy

1. **Migrations are first-class.** Use `eve db new` to create migration files. Use `eve db migrate` to apply them. Never modify production schemas by hand.
2. **Design for RLS from the start.** If agents or users will query the database directly, scaffold RLS helpers early: `eve db rls init --with-groups`. Retrofitting row-level security is painful.
3. **Inspect before changing.** Use `eve db schema` to examine current schema. Use `eve db sql --env <env>` for ad-hoc queries during development. Use `--direct-url` mode for local dev tools that need a raw connection string.
4. **Separate app data from agent data.** Use distinct schemas or naming conventions. App tables serve the product; agent tables serve memory and coordination (see `eve-agent-memory` for storage patterns).

### Access Patterns

| Who Queries | How | Auth |
|-------------|-----|------|
| App service | `${managed.db.url}` in service env | Connection string injected at deploy |
| Agent via CLI | `eve db sql --env <env>` | Job token scopes access |
| Agent via RLS | SQL with `app.current_user_id()` | Session context set by runtime |

## Build and Release Pipeline

### The Canonical Flow

Every production app should follow `build -> release -> deploy`:

```yaml
pipelines:
  deploy:
    steps:
      - name: build
        action:
          type: build        # Creates BuildSpec + BuildRun, produces image digests
      - name: release
        depends_on: [build]
        action:
          type: release      # Creates immutable release from build artifacts
      - name: deploy
        depends_on: [release]
        action:
          type: deploy       # Deploys release to target environment
```

**Why this matters**: The build step produces SHA256 image digests. The release step pins those exact digests. The deploy step uses the pinned release. You deploy exactly what you built — no tag drift, no "latest" surprises.

### Registry Decisions

| Option | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| `registry: "eve"` | Default. Internal registry with JWT auth. Simplest setup. |
| BYO registry (GHCR, ECR) | When you need images accessible outside Eve, or have existing CI. |
| `registry: "none"` | Public base images only. No custom builds. |

For GHCR, add OCI labels to Dockerfiles for automatic repository linking:
```dockerfile
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.source="https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/YOUR_REPO"
```

### Build Configuration

Every service with a custom image needs a `build` section:

```yaml
services:
  api:
    build:
      context: ./apps/api
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: ghcr.io/org/my-api
```

Use multi-stage Dockerfiles. BuildKit handles them natively. Place the OCI label on the final stage.

## Deployment and Environments

### Environment Strategy

| Environment | Type | Purpose | Pipeline |
|-------------|------|---------|----------|
| `staging` | persistent | Integration testing, demos | `deploy` |
| `production` | persistent | Live traffic | `deploy` (with promotion) |
| `preview-*` | temporary | PR previews, feature branches | `deploy` (auto-cleanup) |

Link each environment to a pipeline in the manifest:

```yaml
environments:
  staging:
    pipeline: deploy
  production:
    pipeline: deploy
```

### Deployment Patterns

**Standard deploy**: `eve env deploy staging --ref main --repo-dir .` triggers the linked pipeline.

**Direct deploy** (bypass pipeline): `eve env deploy staging --ref <sha> --direct` for emergencies or simple setups.

**Promotion**: Build once in staging, then promote the same release artifacts to production. The build step's digests carry forward, guaranteeing identical images.

### Recovery

When a deploy fails:
1. **Diagnose**: `eve env diagnose <project> <env>` — shows health, recent deploys, service status.
2. **Logs**: `eve env logs <project> <env>` — container output.
3. **Rollback**: Redeploy the previous known-good release.
4. **Reset**: `eve env reset <project> <env>` — nuclear option, reprovisions from scratch.

Design your app to be rollback-safe: migrations should be forward-compatible, and services should handle schema version mismatches gracefully during rolling deploys.

## Secrets and Configuration

### Scoping Model

Secrets resolve with cascading precedence: **project > user > org > system**. A project-level `API_KEY` overrides an org-level `API_KEY`.

### Design Rules

1. **Set secrets per-project.** Use `eve secrets set KEY "value" --project proj_xxx`. Keep project secrets self-contained.
2. **Use interpolation in the manifest.** Reference `${secret.KEY}` in service environment blocks. The platform resolves at deploy time.
3. **Validate before deploying.** Run `eve manifest validate --validate-secrets` to catch missing secret references before they cause deploy failures.
4. **Use `.eve/dev-secrets.yaml` for local development.** Mirror the production secret keys with local values. This file is gitignored.
5. **Never store secrets in environment variables directly.** Always use `${secret.KEY}` interpolation. This ensures secrets flow through the platform's resolution and audit chain.

### Git Credentials

Agents need repository access. Set either `github_token` (HTTPS) or `ssh_key` (SSH) as project secrets. The worker injects these automatically during git operations.

## SSO Authentication

### Adding SSO to Your App

Eve provides shared auth packages that eliminate boilerplate. Add Eve SSO login in ~25 lines of code.

**Backend** (`@eve-horizon/auth`):

```typescript
import { eveUserAuth, eveAuthGuard, eveAuthConfig } from '@eve-horizon/auth';

app.use(eveUserAuth());                                     // Parse tokens (non-blocking)
app.get('/auth/config', eveAuthConfig());                   // Serve SSO discovery
app.get('/auth/me', eveAuthGuard(), (req, res) => {
  res.json(req.eveUser);                                    // { id, email, orgId, role }
});
app.use('/api', eveAuthGuard());                            // Protect all API routes
```

**Frontend** (`@eve-horizon/auth-react`):

```tsx
import { EveAuthProvider, EveLoginGate } from '@eve-horizon/auth-react';

function App() {
  return (
    <EveAuthProvider apiUrl="/api">
      <EveLoginGate>
        <ProtectedApp />
      </EveLoginGate>
    </EveAuthProvider>
  );
}
```

For authenticated API calls from components, use `createEveClient`:

```typescript
import { createEveClient } from '@eve-horizon/auth-react';
const client = createEveClient('/api');
const res = await client.fetch('/data');
```

**Custom auth gate** — When you need control over loading and login states (custom login page, richer loading UI), use `useEveAuth()` directly instead of `EveLoginGate`:

```tsx
import { EveAuthProvider, useEveAuth } from '@eve-horizon/auth-react';

function AuthGate() {
  const { user, loading, loginWithToken, loginWithSso, logout } = useEveAuth();
  if (loading) return <Spinner />;
  if (!user) return <LoginPage onSso={loginWithSso} onToken={loginWithToken} />;
  return <AppShell user={user} onLogout={logout}><Routes /></AppShell>;
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <EveAuthProvider apiUrl={API_BASE}>
      <AuthGate />
    </EveAuthProvider>
  );
}
```

### How It Works

1. `EveAuthProvider` checks `sessionStorage` for cached token
2. If no token, probes SSO broker `/session` (root-domain cookie)
3. If SSO session exists, gets fresh Eve RS256 token
4. If no session, shows login form (SSO redirect or token paste)
5. All API requests include `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

### NestJS Backend

Apply `eveUserAuth()` as global middleware in `main.ts`. If existing controllers expect `req.user` rather than `req.eveUser`, add a thin bridge that maps Eve roles to app-specific roles in one place:

```typescript
import { eveUserAuth } from '@eve-horizon/auth';

app.use(eveUserAuth());
app.use((req, _res, next) => {
  if (req.eveUser) {
    req.user = { ...req.eveUser, role: req.eveUser.role === 'member' ? 'viewer' : 'admin' };
  }
  next();
});
```

### Auto-Injected Variables

The platform injects `EVE_SSO_URL`, `EVE_API_URL`, and `EVE_ORG_ID` into deployed containers. No manual configuration needed. Use `${SSO_URL}` in manifest env blocks for frontend-accessible SSO URLs.

### Design Rules

1. **Use the SDK, not custom auth.** The SDK replaces ~750 lines of hand-rolled auth with ~50 lines.
2. **Non-blocking middleware first.** Use `eveUserAuth()` globally, then `eveAuthGuard()` on protected routes. This enables mixed public/private routes.
3. **The `/auth/config` endpoint is the handshake.** The frontend discovers the SSO URL by calling the backend's `eveAuthConfig()` endpoint. This decouples the frontend from platform env vars and works identically in local dev and deployed environments.
4. **Design for token staleness.** The `orgs` JWT claim reflects membership at mint time (1-day TTL). Use `strategy: 'remote'` for immediate revocation if needed.

For full SDK reference, see `references/auth-sdk.md` in the `eve-read-eve-docs` skill.

## Observability and Debugging

### The Debugging Ladder

Escalate through these stages:

```
1. Status    → eve env show <project> <env>
2. Diagnose  → eve env diagnose <project> <env>
3. Logs      → eve env logs <project> <env>
4. Pipeline  → eve pipeline logs <pipeline> <run-id> --follow
5. Recover   → eve env deploy (rollback) or eve env reset
```

Start at the top. Each stage provides more detail and more cost. Most issues resolve at stages 1-2.

### Pipeline Observability

Monitor pipeline execution in real time:

```bash
eve pipeline logs <pipeline> <run-id> --follow         # stream all steps
eve pipeline logs <pipeline> <run-id> --follow --step build  # stream one step
```

Failed steps include failure hints and link to build diagnostics when applicable.

### Build Debugging

When builds fail:

```bash
eve build list --project <project_id>
eve build diagnose <build_id>
eve build logs <build_id>
```

Common causes: missing registry credentials, Dockerfile path mismatch, build context too large.

### Health Checks

Design services with health endpoints. Eve polls health to determine deployment readiness. A deploy is complete when `ready === true` and `active_pipeline_run === null`.
