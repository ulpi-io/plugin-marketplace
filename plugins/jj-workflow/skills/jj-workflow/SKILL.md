# jj Workflow

## Philosophy

1. **Commits are cheap, descriptions are mandatory.** The working copy is always a commit. Never leave it as "(no description set)".
2. **Experiment freely, the oplog is your safety net.** Every mutation is recorded. `jj undo` and `jj op restore` make anything reversible.
3. **Conflicts are state, not emergencies.** jj stores conflicts in commits as structured data. Rebase succeeds even with conflicts. Resolve when ready.
4. **Change IDs are your handle on work.** Commit hashes change on rewrite; change IDs don't. Use change IDs to refer to work across rebases and squashes.
5. **Bookmarks exist for GitHub, not for you.** Work with anonymous changes. Add bookmarks only when you need to push.
6. **Keep the stack shallow.** Squash early. Don't let history grow 10 commits deep before curating.
7. **Use `absorb` over manual squash routing.** When fixing across a stack, let jj figure out where each hunk belongs.
8. **Colocated = invisible to the team.** Teammates see standard git. They don't know you use jj.

## CRITICAL: AI-Specific Rules

**Always use `-m` flag** to prevent jj from opening an editor:

```bash
# WRONG - opens editor, blocks AI
jj new
jj describe
jj commit
jj squash

# CORRECT - non-interactive
jj new -m "message"
jj describe -m "message"
jj commit -m "message"
jj squash -m "message"
```

**Never use these interactive commands** (no non-interactive mode):

- `jj split` / `jj split -i`
- `jj squash -i`
- `jj diffedit`

## Core Concepts

### Working Copy = Commit

There is no staging area. Every file edit is automatically tracked in `@` (the current change). No `git add` needed.

- `@` = your current change (working copy commit)
- `@-` = parent of current change
- `@--` = grandparent

### Change IDs vs Commit IDs

Every change has two identifiers:

- **Change ID** (e.g., `kpqxywon`) — stable across rewrites. Use this to refer to work.
- **Commit ID** (e.g., `a1b2c3d4`) — changes when content is rewritten.

When you squash, rebase, or amend, the change ID stays the same. This means you can bookmark a change ID mentally and it always resolves, unlike git commit hashes.

#### Accessing Previous Versions (`xyz/n` syntax)

Every rewrite of a change is recorded. Access previous versions with `<change-id>/n`:

- `xyz/0` — latest (current) version (same as `xyz`)
- `xyz/1` — previous version
- `xyz/2` — two versions ago

This is useful for restoring a change to its earlier state:

```bash
jj restore --from xyz/1 --to xyz    # Revert xyz to its previous contents
jj diff --from xyz/1 --to xyz      # See what changed between versions
```

### Conflicts Are Just State

When a rebase produces conflicts, jj records the conflict in the commit and succeeds. No "rebase in progress" blocking state. No `--continue` ceremony.

- Descendants of conflicted commits work normally
- Resolve conflicts whenever convenient — check out the commit, fix files, done
- `jj log` marks conflicted commits so you can spot them

## Workflows

### The Squash Workflow (Recommended)

```bash
jj describe -m "feat: what I'm building"   # State intent on current change
jj new -m "wip"                             # New empty change on top
# ... make changes ...
jj squash -m "feat: done"                   # Squash into parent
```

### The Commit Workflow (Simpler)

```bash
# ... make changes ...
jj commit -m "feat: what I did"             # Describe + create new change in one step
# ... keep working ...
```

`jj commit` is equivalent to `jj describe -m "..." && jj new`.

### The Edit Workflow (Mid-Stack Fixes)

Need to fix something in an older change? No stash/rebase-i dance:

```bash
jj edit <change-id>        # Switch working copy to that change
# ... make your fix ...
jj new -m "back to work"   # Return to tip (descendants auto-rebased)
```

All descendants of the edited change are automatically rebased.

### Parallel Experiments

```bash
jj new main -m "approach A"           # Branch from main
jj new main -m "approach B"           # Another branch from main (not from A)
jj diff --from <A-id> --to <B-id>    # Compare approaches
jj edit <winner-id>                   # Continue with the winner
jj abandon <loser-id>                 # Discard the loser
```

## Absorb: Smart Squash Routing

When you have a stack of changes and make fixes in `@`, `jj absorb` automatically distributes each hunk to the ancestor where those lines were last modified.

```bash
# You're at the top of a 3-commit stack, fixing bugs across all of them
jj absorb    # Each fix goes to the right commit automatically
```

Use `jj absorb` when fixing across a stack. Use `jj squash` when you know exactly where changes should go.

## Bookmarks & Pushing

Bookmarks are jj's equivalent of git branches, but they **don't auto-advance**. You must move them explicitly.

### Push to main

```bash
jj bookmark set master -r @-        # Point bookmark at your commit (not empty @)
jj git push
```

### Feature branches

```bash
# Create and push
jj bookmark create feature-x -r @-
jj git push

# Update after more work
jj bookmark set feature-x -r @-
jj git push
```

### Addressing PR feedback

```bash
jj new feature-x- -m "address review feedback"
# ... make changes ...
jj squash -m "feat: updated per review"
jj bookmark set feature-x -r @-
jj git push
```

## Revsets

Revsets are a functional language for selecting commits. Beyond `@` and `@-`:

| Expression            | Meaning                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `@`                   | Current working copy       |
| `@-`                  | Parent                     |
| `@--`                 | Grandparent                |
| `x+`                  | Children of x              |
| `x::`                 | All descendants of x       |
| `::x`                 | All ancestors of x         |
| `trunk()`             | The trunk/main commit      |
| `bookmarks()`         | All bookmarked commits     |
| `empty()`             | Empty commits              |
| `divergent()`         | Divergent changes          |
| `remote_tags()`       | Remote tags                |
| `diff_lines("text")`  | Commits with matching diff |
| `description("text")` | Filter by description      |
| `author("name")`      | Filter by author           |

Useful examples:

```bash
jj log -r 'trunk()..@'              # Everything between main and here
jj log -r '::@ & ~::trunk()'         # My branch only
jj log -r 'author("trevor")'         # My commits
```

## Syncing with Remote

```bash
jj git fetch                         # Pull from remote
jj rebase -d master@origin           # Rebase onto updated main
```

## Temporarily Disabling Immutable Commits

When you need to rewrite a commit protected by `immutable_heads()` (e.g., squashing into a remote bookmark):

```bash
# Disable protection (quote the key — parentheses are invalid TOML bare keys)
jj config set --repo 'revset-aliases."immutable_heads()"' 'none()'

# Do your rewrite
jj squash -m "updated message"

# ALWAYS restore protection immediately after
jj config set --repo 'revset-aliases."immutable_heads()"' 'builtin_immutable_heads() | remote_bookmarks()'
```

**Important:** The `NAME` argument requires shell quoting around the TOML key because `immutable_heads()` contains parentheses. Use single quotes around the full dotted key with inner double quotes: `'revset-aliases."immutable_heads()"'`.

**CRITICAL: Always ask the user before disabling immutable protection.** Rewriting remote bookmarks means force-pushing, which rewrites shared history. Confirm with the user before proceeding — never silently disable immutability.

## Recovery

The operation log records every mutation. Nothing is ever truly lost.

```bash
jj op log                            # See all operations
jj undo                              # Undo last operation
jj op restore <id>                   # Jump to any past state
jj evolog                            # See how current change evolved
jj evolog -r <change-id>             # See how any change evolved
```

## Recommended Config

User config lives at `~/.config/jj/config.toml`:

```toml
[remotes.origin]
auto-track-bookmarks = "*"

[revset-aliases]
# Prevent rewriting pushed commits
'immutable_heads()' = 'builtin_immutable_heads() | remote_bookmarks()'
# Shorthand for trunk
'trunk()' = 'master@origin'
```

## Bail Out

```bash
rm -rf .jj    # Delete jj state, keep git unchanged
```
