# Kernel CLI

The Kernel CLI provides command-line access to Kernel's cloud browser platform for browser automation, serverless app deployment, and infrastructure management.

## Installation

- Homebrew: `brew install kernel/tap/kernel` (>=v0.13.4)
- npm: `npm install -g @onkernel/cli` (>=v0.13.4)

## Authentication

- **Preferred:** Set `KERNEL_API_KEY` environment variable
- **Fallback:** Run `kernel login` for interactive OAuth

## Quick Start

```bash
# Authenticate
export KERNEL_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Create a browser session
kernel browsers create

# Run Playwright automation
kernel browsers playwright execute <session_id> 'await page.goto("https://example.com")'

# Take a screenshot
kernel browsers computer screenshot <session_id> --to screenshot.png

# Cleanup
kernel browsers delete <session_id> --yes
```
