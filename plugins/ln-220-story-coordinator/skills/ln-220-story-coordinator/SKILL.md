# Story Coordinator

## Purpose

Coordinates Story creation (CREATE), replanning (REPLAN), and appending (ADD) for one or more Epics, producing 5-10 User Stories per Epic with standards research, Decompose-First Pattern, multi-epic routing, and delegation to ln-221/ln-222 workers.

## When to Use This Skill

Use when:
- Decompose Epic to User Stories (5-10 Stories covering Epic scope)
- Update existing Stories when Epic requirements change
- Rebalance Story scopes within Epic
- Add new Stories to existing Epic structure
- Request spans multiple Epics (routing auto-groups Stories by correct Epic)
- Story doesn't fit any existing Epic (creates stub Epic inline)

## Core Pattern: Decompose-First

**Key principle:** Build IDEAL Story plan FIRST, THEN check existing Stories to determine mode:
- **No existing Stories** → CREATE MODE (delegate to ln-221-story-creator)
- **Has existing Stories** → REPLAN MODE (delegate to ln-222-story-replanner)

**Rationale:** Ensures consistent Story decomposition based on current Epic requirements, independent of existing Story structure (may be outdated).

## Story Numbering Convention

**MANDATORY READ:** Load `shared/references/numbering_conventions.md` for Story numbering rules (US001 sequential across Epics, no Story 0).

## Quality Criteria

**MANDATORY READ:** Load `shared/references/creation_quality_checklist.md` §Story Creation Checklist for validation criteria that ln-310 will enforce.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Source | Description |
|-------|----------|--------|-------------|
| `epicId` | Yes | args, kanban, user | Primary Epic to process |

**Resolution:** Epic Resolution Chain.
**Status filter:** Active (planned/started)
**Multi-epic:** If IDEAL plan (Phase 3) produces Stories that don't fit resolved Epic, Phase 3 Step 7 auto-routes them to correct Epics (or creates stub Epics inline).

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Tools Config

**MANDATORY READ:** Load `shared/references/tools_config_guide.md`, `shared/references/storage_mode_detection.md`, `shared/references/input_resolution_pattern.md`

Extract: `task_provider` = Task Management → Provider

### Phase 1: Context Assembly

**Objective:** Gather context for Story planning (Epic details, planning questions, frontend context, fallback docs, user input)

**Step 1: Discovery (Automated)**

Auto-discovers from `docs/tasks/kanban_board.md`:

1. **Resolve epicId** (per input_resolution_pattern.md):
   - IF args provided → use args
   - ELSE IF git branch matches `feature/epic-{N}-*` → extract Epic N
   - ELSE IF kanban has exactly 1 active Epic → suggest
   - ELSE → AskUserQuestion: show active Epics from kanban
2. **Team ID:** Reads Linear Configuration table
3. **Load Epic description:**
   - **IF task_provider == "linear":** `get_project(query="Epic N")` → Fetch full Epic document
   - **ELSE:** `Read("docs/tasks/epics/epic-{N}-*/epic.md")` → Load file-based Epic
   - **Extract:** Goal, Scope In/Out, Success Criteria, Technical Notes
   - **Note:** Epic N = Linear Project number (global), NOT initiative-internal index (Epic 0-N)
4. **Next Story Number:** Reads Epic Story Counters table → Gets next sequential number

**Step 2: Load Active Epics Metadata**

Load ALL active Epics from `docs/tasks/kanban_board.md` → Epics Overview section:
- Extract: Epic number, title for each active Epic
- Store as `allEpics[]` for Phase 3 Epic Routing (Step 7)
- Lightweight: titles from kanban only, NOT full Epic documents

**Step 3: Extract Planning Information (Automated)**

Parses Epic structure for Story planning questions:

| Question | Extraction Source |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Q1 - User/Persona** | Epic Goal ("Enable [persona]...") + Scope In (user roles) |
| **Q2 - What they want** | Epic Scope In (capabilities) + functional requirements |
| **Q3 - Why it matters** | Epic Success Criteria (metrics) + Goal (business value) |
| **Q4 - Which Epic** | Already from Step 1 |
| **Q5 - Main AC** | Derive from Epic Scope In features → testable scenarios |
| **Q6 - Application type** | Epic Technical Notes (UI/API mentioned) → Default: API |

**Step 4: Frontend Research (Optional)**

**Trigger:** If Q2 (capabilities) OR Q5 (AC) missing after Step 3

**Process:**
1. Scan HTML files: `Glob` `**/*.html`, `src/**/*.html`
2. Extract: forms → AC scenarios, buttons → capabilities, validation rules → edge case AC
3. Combine with Epic context, deduplicate, prioritize Epic AC if conflict

**Fallback:** If no HTML → Skip to Step 5

**Step 5: Fallback Search Chain**

**Objective:** Fill missing Q1-Q6 BEFORE asking user.

For each question with no answer from Step 3-4:

| Question | Fallback Search |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Q1 (User/Persona)** | Search `requirements.md` for "User personas", "Actors" → Default "User" if not found |
| **Q3 (Why it matters)** | Search `requirements.md` for "Business objectives", "Goals" → Infer from Epic Success Criteria |
| **Q6 (Application type)** | Search `tech_stack.md` for "Frontend", "Backend", "API" → Default "API" |

**Skip:** Q2, Q5 (Epic + HTML are sources of truth), Q4 (already known)

**Step 6: User Input (Only if Missing)**

**If still missing after Step 3 + 4 + 5:**
- Show extracted: "From Epic: [Epic info]. From HTML: [HTML info]. From fallback: [fallback info]"
- Ask user to confirm or provide remaining missing details

**If all questions answered from Epic OR HTML OR fallback:** Skip user prompts, proceed to Phase 2

**Output:** Complete context (Epic details, next Story number, Q1-Q6 answers)

---

### Phase 2: Standards Research (Delegated)

**Objective:** Research industry standards/patterns BEFORE Story generation to ensure implementation follows best practices.

**Why:** Prevents outdated patterns or RFC violations (e.g., OAuth without PKCE).

**Process:**

1. **Parse Epic for domain keywords:** Extract domain from Epic goal/Scope In (authentication, rate limiting, payments)
2. **Delegate to ln-001-standards-researcher:**
   - Call `Skill(skill: "ln-001-standards-researcher", epic_description="[Epic full description]", story_domain="[domain]")`
   - Wait for Standards Research (Markdown string)
3. **Store:** Cache for Phase 5a/5b (workers insert in Story Technical Notes)

**Output:** Standards Research stored for ALL Stories in Epic

**Skip conditions:**
- Epic has NO standards in Technical Notes
- Story domain is trivial CRUD
- Epic says "research not needed"

**Time-box:** 15-20 minutes (handled by ln-001)

**Note:** Research done ONCE per Epic, results reused for all Stories (5-10 Stories benefit from single research)

---

### Phase 3: Planning

**Objective:** Build IDEAL Story plan, determine execution mode

**Story Grouping Guidelines:**

Each Story = ONE vertical slice of user capability (end-to-end: UI → API → Service → DB). Size limits per `creation_quality_checklist.md` #9.

| Pattern | Example | Verdict |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Vertical slice (1 user journey) | "User registration" (form→API→DB→email) | GOOD Story |
| Horizontal slice (1 layer) | "Create user table", "Registration API endpoint" | BAD → Task, not Story |
| Incremental DB (per Story) | "Product search" → creates Products table | GOOD |
| Big-bang DB (all upfront) | "Setup database" → creates 50 tables | BAD → no user value |

**Build IDEAL Plan (Automated):**

1. **Articulate REAL GOAL:** **MANDATORY READ:** `shared/references/goal_articulation_gate.md` — State REAL GOAL of this Epic in one sentence (the user capability being enabled, not "create Stories"). Verify: does the decomposition serve THIS goal?
2. **Analyze Epic Scope:** Review features in Epic Scope In, identify user capabilities
3. **Determine Story Count:**
   - Simple Epic (1-3 features): 3-5 Stories
   - Medium Epic (4-7 features): 6-8 Stories
   - Complex Epic (8+ features): 8-10 Stories
   - **Max 10 Stories per Epic**

4. **Story Size:** Limits per `creation_quality_checklist.md` #9. Outside range → split or merge.

5. **Build IDEAL Plan "in mind":**
   - Each Story: persona + capability + business value
   - Each Story: testable AC per checklist #4
   - Stories ordered by dependency (no forward deps per checklist #18)
   - Each Story: Test Strategy section exists but is **empty** (tests planned later by test planner)
   - Each Story: Technical Notes (architecture, integrations, **Standards Research from Phase 2**, guide links)
   - Each Story: `orchestratorBrief` for ln-1000 pipeline lead:
     ```
     orchestratorBrief: {
       tech: "<languages, frameworks, key libraries from Epic context>",
       keyFiles: "<2-5 files/dirs most affected>",
       approach: "<1-line implementation strategy>",
       complexity: "Low|Medium|High (<reason>)"
     }
     ```

6. **AC Quality Validation:** Rules per `creation_quality_checklist.md` #4. Workers (ln-221, ln-222) must validate.

**INVEST Score (0-6 per Story):** Validate per `creation_quality_checklist.md` INVEST criteria (loaded above). Gate: Score ≥ 4 → proceed, < 4 → rework.

7. **Epic Routing**

**Objective:** Ensure each Story in IDEAL plan is assigned to the correct Epic. Handles multi-epic requests and missing Epics.

**Process:** Routing always runs (keyword matching is cheap). After tagging, if ALL Stories match `resolvedEpicId` → SINGLE-EPIC fast path (common case).

**Routing (multiple active Epics):**

```
FOR EACH Story in IDEAL plan:
  1. Compare Story domain/capability keywords vs resolved Epic Scope In
     - IF match → tag Story with resolvedEpicId
  2. ELSE compare vs allEpics[] scopes (load Epic descriptions on-demand for ambiguous matches)
     - IF matches another Epic → tag with that epicId
     - IF matches NO Epic → tag as NEEDS_NEW_EPIC

ANALYZE tags:
  - ALL resolvedEpicId → SINGLE-EPIC (proceed as before)
  - Mixed tags → MULTI-EPIC:
    a. Group: epicGroups = {epicId: Story[]}
    b. Show ROUTING PREVIEW (see format below)
    c. User confirms or reassigns Stories
    d. NEEDS_NEW_EPIC Stories → create stub Epic inline:
       1. Read kanban_board.md → Next Epic Number, teamId
       2. Create Epic (Linear: save_project, File: mkdir + Write minimal epic.md)
       3. Update kanban_board.md: increment Next Epic Number, add Epic Story Counters row, add to Epics Overview → Active
       4. Assign returned epicId to tagged Stories
```

**Routing Preview Format:**
```
EPIC ROUTING PREVIEW

Epic 7 (OAuth Authentication): 4 Stories
  - US004: Register OAuth client
  - US005: Request access token
  - US006: Validate token
  - US007: Refresh token

Epic 12 (User Management): 2 Stories
  - US008: User profile settings
  - US009: Account deletion

NEW EPIC NEEDED: 1 Story
  - US010: Payment webhook handler
    Suggested domain: Payment Processing

Confirm routing? (or reassign Stories between Epics)
```

**Output:** `epicGroups` — map of epicId to Story[] (for single-epic: one group with all Stories)

---

### Phase 4: Check Existing & Detect Mode

**Objective:** Determine execution mode based on existing Stories AND user intent, per each Epic group from Phase 3 routing.

**Process:** FOR EACH epicGroup in `epicGroups`, query task provider for existing Stories:

**IF task_provider == "linear":**
```
list_issues(project=epicGroup.epicId, label="user-story")
```

**ELSE (file mode):**
```
Glob("docs/tasks/epics/epic-{N}-*/stories/*/story.md")
```

**Mode Detection (per epicGroup):**

1. **Analyze user request** for keywords:
   - ADD keywords: "add story", "one more story", "additional story", "append"
   - REPLAN keywords: "update plan", "revise", "requirements changed", "replan stories"

2. **Decision matrix:**

| Condition | Mode | Delegate To |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Count = 0 | **CREATE** | Phase 5a: ln-221-story-creator |
| Count ≥ 1 AND ADD keywords | **ADD** | Phase 5c: ln-221-story-creator (appendMode) |
| Count ≥ 1 AND REPLAN keywords | **REPLAN** | Phase 5b: ln-222-story-replanner |
| Count ≥ 1 AND ambiguous | **ASK USER** | "Add new Story or revise the plan?" |

**Important:** Orchestrator loads metadata ONLY (ID, title, status). Workers load FULL descriptions (token efficiency).

**Output:** `epicGroupModes` — map of epicId to {mode, existingCount, epicData} for each group

---

### Phase 5: Delegate to Workers

**Iteration:** Process each epicGroup sequentially (workers include user interaction, cannot parallelize).

```
FOR EACH epicGroup in epicGroupModes:
  IF mode == CREATE  → Phase 5a (ln-221-story-creator)
  IF mode == REPLAN  → Phase 5b (ln-222-story-replanner)
  IF mode == ADD     → Phase 5c (ln-221-story-creator, appendMode)
```

Workers receive the same interface: `epicData + idealPlan` for ONE Epic.

#### Phase 5a: Delegate CREATE (No Existing Stories)

**Trigger:** Epic has no Stories yet (first decomposition)

**Delegation:**

Call ln-221-story-creator via Skill tool:

```javascript
Skill(
  skill: "ln-221-story-creator",
  epicData: {id, title, description},
  idealPlan: [ /* 5-10 Stories from Phase 3 */ ],
  standardsResearch: "Standards Research from Phase 2",
  teamId: "team-id",
  autoApprove: false  // or true for automation
)
```

**Worker handles:**
- Generate Story documents (9 sections, insert Standards Research)
- Validate INVEST criteria
- Show preview
- User confirmation (if autoApprove=false)
- Create in Linear (project=Epic, labels=user-story, state=Backlog)
- Update kanban_board.md (Epic Grouping Algorithm)

**Output:** Created Story URLs + summary from worker

---

#### Phase 5b: Delegate REPLAN (Existing Stories Found)

**MANDATORY READ:** Load `references/replan_algorithm.md`

**Trigger:** Epic already has Stories (requirements changed)

**Delegation:**

Call ln-222-story-replanner via Skill tool:

```javascript
Skill(
  skill: "ln-222-story-replanner",
  epicData: {id, title, description},
  idealPlan: [ /* 5-10 Stories from Phase 3 */ ],
  standardsResearch: "Standards Research from Phase 2",
  existingCount: N,
  teamId: "team-id",
  autoApprove: false  // or true for automation
)
```

**Worker handles:**
- Load existing Stories (Progressive Loading: ONE BY ONE for token efficiency)
- Compare IDEAL vs existing (KEEP/UPDATE/OBSOLETE/CREATE operations)
- Show replan summary with diffs (AC, Standards Research, Technical Notes)
- User confirmation (if autoApprove=false)
- Execute operations (respecting status constraints: Backlog/Todo only, warnings for In Progress/Review/Done)
- Update kanban_board.md (add NEW Stories only via Epic Grouping Algorithm)

**Output:** Operation results + warnings + affected Story URLs from worker

---

#### Phase 5c: Delegate ADD (Append to Existing Stories)

**Trigger:** Epic has Stories, user wants to ADD more (not replan existing)

**Delegation:**

Call ln-221-story-creator via Skill tool with appendMode:

```javascript
Skill(
  skill: "ln-221-story-creator",
  appendMode: true,  // ADD to existing, don't replace
  epicData: {id, title, description},
  newStoryDescription: userRequestedStory,  // Single Story from user request
  standardsResearch: "Standards Research from Phase 2",
  teamId: "team-id",
  autoApprove: false
)
```

`appendMode: true` — creates only user-requested Story(s), skips IDEAL plan comparison.

**Worker handles:**
- Research standards for NEW Story only
- Generate Story document (9 sections)
- Validate INVEST criteria
- Create in Linear (append to existing)
- Update kanban_board.md

**Output:** Created Story URL + summary from worker

---

### Phase 6: Commit

After ALL workers complete (any mode: CREATE/REPLAN/ADD):

1. `git add docs/tasks/kanban_board.md` (updated by worker)
2. `git commit` with message:
   - **Single-epic:** `"ln-220: create Stories US{first}-US{last} for Epic {N}"`
   - **Multi-epic:** `"ln-220: create Stories for Epics {N1}, {N2}, {N3}"`
   - REPLAN: `"ln-220: replan Stories for Epic {N}"`
   - ADD: `"ln-220: add Story US{num} to Epic {N}"`

---

### Phase 7: Self-Check

**Objective:** Verify all skill phases completed and all planned Stories accounted for.

**Process:**

1. **Phase Completion:** Verify Phases 0-6 completed (or skipped with documented reason). Report any missed phase.

2. **Story Accounting:**
   - Planned Stories (from IDEAL plan): N
   - Created/updated Stories (from worker results): M
   - IF N ≠ M → WARNING: list missing Stories by title

3. **Epic Routing Verification (multi-epic only):**
   - Verify all epicGroups processed by workers
   - Verify all NEEDS_NEW_EPIC Stories resolved (assigned to created Epics)

4. **Output:**
```
SELF-CHECK RESULTS

Phases: 7/7 completed (or K/7 + skipped reasons)
Stories: M/N created
Epics: K epic(s) processed

Status: PASS / FAIL (with details)
```

IF FAIL → list which Stories were lost, recommend re-running for missed epicGroups.

---

**TodoWrite format (mandatory):**
Add phases to todos before starting:
```
- Phase 1: Context Assembly (in_progress)
- Phase 2: Standards Research via ln-001 (pending)
- Phase 3: Build IDEAL Story Plan + Epic Routing (pending)
- Phase 4: Check Existing Stories (pending)
- Phase 5: Delegate to ln-221/ln-222 (pending)
- Wait for worker result (pending)
- Phase 6: Commit kanban changes (pending)
- Phase 7: Self-Check (pending)
```
Mark each as in_progress when starting, completed when done.

---

## Critical Rules

- **Decompose-First:** Build IDEAL Story plan before checking existing Stories (prevents anchoring to suboptimal structure)
- **Vertical slicing only:** Each Story = one user journey end-to-end (UI -> API -> Service -> DB); no horizontal/technical-only Stories
- **Standards research before generation:** Phase 2 (ln-001) must complete before Story documents are created; results go into all Story Technical Notes
- **Orchestrator loads metadata only:** ID, title, status (~50 tokens per Story); workers load full descriptions (~5,000 tokens) when needed
- **Test Strategy section left empty:** Tests are planned later by test planner, not at Story creation time
- **Epic Routing fast path:** Routing always runs. If all Stories match resolved Epic (common case), no user confirmation needed and zero branching overhead (Phase 3 Step 7)
- **Self-Check mandatory:** Phase 7 always runs. Verifies N planned == M created, all phases completed. Never skipped

---

## Integration with Ecosystem

**Called by:**
- **ln-200-scope-decomposer** (Phase 3) - automated full decomposition (scope → Epics → Stories)
- **Manual** - user invokes for Epic Story creation/replanning

**Upstream:**
- **ln-210-epic-coordinator** - creates Epics (prerequisite for Story creation)

**Downstream:**
- **ln-300-task-coordinator** - creates implementation tasks for each Story
- **ln-310-multi-agent-validator** - validates Story structure/content
- **ln-400-story-executor** - orchestrates task execution for Story

## Example Usage

**CREATE MODE (First Time):**
```
"Create stories for Epic 7: OAuth Authentication"
```

**Process:**
1. Phase 1: Context Assembly → Discovery (Team "API", Epic 7, US004), Extract (Persona: API client, Value: secure API access), Frontend Research (HTML login/register forms → AC), Fallback Search (requirements.md for personas)
2. Phase 2: Standards Research → Epic mentions "OAuth 2.0", delegate ln-001 → Standards Research with RFC 6749, patterns
3. Phase 3: Planning → Build IDEAL (5 Stories: "Register client", "Request token", "Validate token", "Refresh token", "Revoke token")
4. Phase 4: Check Existing → Count = 0 → CREATE MODE
5. Phase 5a: Delegate CREATE → Call ln-221-story-creator → US004-US008 created with Standards Research

**REPLAN MODE (Requirements Changed):**
```
"Replan stories for Epic 7 - removed custom token formats, added scope management"
```

**Process:**
1. Phase 1: Context Assembly → Discovery (Team "API", Epic 7, has US004-US008), Extract (Removed custom formats, added scopes)
2. Phase 2: Standards Research → Epic mentions "OAuth 2.0 scopes", delegate ln-001 → Updated Standards Research with RFC 6749 Section 3.3
3. Phase 3: Planning → Build IDEAL (5 Stories: "Register client", "Request token", "Validate token", "Refresh token", "Manage scopes")
4. Phase 4: Check Existing → Count = 5 → REPLAN MODE
5. Phase 5b: Delegate REPLAN → Call ln-222-story-replanner → KEEP 4, UPDATE Technical Notes (scope research), OBSOLETE US008, CREATE US009

**MULTI-EPIC MODE (Stories span multiple Epics):**
```
"Create stories for user authentication and payment processing"
```

**Process:**
1. Phase 1: Context Assembly → Discovery (resolve to Epic 7: Auth), Step 2 loads allEpics [Epic 7, Epic 12, Epic 14]
2. Phase 2: Standards Research → Research auth + payment standards via ln-001
3. Phase 3: Planning → 8 Stories planned. Step 7 Routing → 5 Stories match Epic 7 (Auth), 3 Stories match Epic 12 (Payments). Routing preview shown, user confirms
4. Phase 4: Check Existing per epicGroup → Epic 7: count=0 (CREATE), Epic 12: count=3 (REPLAN)
5. Phase 5: Delegate CREATE to ln-221 for Epic 7 (5 Stories), then REPLAN to ln-222 for Epic 12 (3 Stories)
6. Phase 6: Commit → `"ln-220: create Stories for Epics 7, 12"`
7. Phase 7: Self-Check → 8/8 Stories created, 2 Epics processed, PASS
