# Universal Task Replanner

Worker that re-syncs existing tasks to the latest requirements for any task type.

## Purpose & Scope
- Load full existing task descriptions from Linear
- Compare them with orchestrator-provided IDEAL plan (implementation/refactoring/test)
- Decide operations (KEEP/UPDATE/OBSOLETE/CREATE) and execute
- Drop NFR items; only functional scope remains
- Update Linear issues and kanban_board.md accordingly

## Task Storage Mode

**MANDATORY READ:** Load `shared/references/tools_config_guide.md`, `shared/references/storage_mode_detection.md`, and `shared/references/input_resolution_pattern.md`

Extract: `task_provider` = Task Management → Provider (`linear` | `file`).

## Invocation (who/when)
- **ln-300-task-coordinator:** REPLAN mode when implementation tasks already exist.
- **Orchestrators (other groups):** Replan refactoring or test tasks as needed.
- **Standalone:** User invokes directly with storyId (resolved via Input Resolution Chain).

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Source | Description |
|-------|----------|--------|-------------|
| `storyId` | Yes | args, git branch, kanban, user | Story whose tasks to replan |

**Resolution:** Story Resolution Chain.
**Status filter:** In Progress, To Review

**Additional inputs (from orchestrator or Story context):**
- Common: `taskType`, teamId, Story data (id/title/description with AC, Technical Notes, Context), existingTaskIds.
- Implementation: idealPlan (1-8 tasks), guideLinks.
- Refactoring: codeQualityIssues, refactoringPlan, affectedComponents.
- Test: manualTestResults, testPlan (Priority ≥15, Usefulness Criteria), infra/doc/cleanup items.

## Template Loading

**MANDATORY READ:** Load `shared/references/template_loading_pattern.md` for template copy workflow. Load `shared/references/destructive_operation_safety.md` for destructive operation keywords and severity classification.

**Template Selection by taskType:**
- `implementation` → `task_template_implementation.md`
- `refactoring` → `refactoring_task_template.md`
- `test` → `test_task_template.md`

**Local copies:** `docs/templates/*.md` (in target project)

## Workflow (concise)
1) **Resolve storyId** (per input_resolution_pattern.md):
   - IF args provided → use args
   - ELSE IF git branch matches Story pattern → use detected Story
   - ELSE IF kanban has exactly 1 Story in [In Progress, To Review] → suggest
   - ELSE → AskUserQuestion: show In Progress/To Review Stories from kanban
2) Load templates per taskType (see Template Loading) and fetch full existing task descriptions.
3) Normalize both sides (IDEAL vs existing sections) and run replan algorithm to classify KEEP/UPDATE/OBSOLETE/CREATE.
   - **Inherited Assumptions (UPDATE):** Preserve Inherited Assumptions from parent Story. If parent Story Assumptions changed, update Inherited Assumptions in affected tasks to match current Story registry (ID + text sync).
   - **Inherited Assumptions (CREATE):** For new tasks, extract relevant assumptions from parent Story Assumptions table, add to Context > Inherited Assumptions using `A{N} ({CATEGORY})` format.
   - **Destructive Op Detection (UPDATE):** After updating Implementation Plan, re-scan for keywords from destructive_operation_safety.md (loaded above). IF detected AND "Destructive Operation Safety" section missing → add section from shared reference template. IF section already present → preserve it.
   - **Destructive Op Detection (CREATE):** For new tasks, scan Implementation Plan for keywords from destructive_operation_safety.md (loaded above). IF detected → include "Destructive Operation Safety" section from shared reference template (MANDATORY). Fill all 5 fields + severity.
4) Present summary (counts, titles, key diffs). Confirmation required if running interactively.
5) Execute operations in Linear: update descriptions, cancel obsolete, **create missing with state="Backlog"**, preserve parentId for updates.
6) Update kanban_board.md: remove canceled, add new tasks under Story in Backlog.
7) Return operations summary with URLs and warnings.

## Type Rules (must hold after update)
| taskType | Hard rule | What to enforce |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| implementation | No new test creation | Updated/created tasks must not introduce test creation text |
| refactoring | Regression strategy required | Issues + severity, 3-phase plan, regression strategy, preserve functionality |
| test | Risk-based limits | Priority ≥15 scenarios covered; each test passes Usefulness Criteria; no framework/library/DB tests |

## Critical Notes
- **MANDATORY:** Always pass `state: "Backlog"` when creating new tasks (CREATE operation). Linear defaults to team's default status (often "Postponed") if not specified.
- **Destructive Op Detection:** Use keyword list from destructive_operation_safety.md (loaded above). If found after update/create → include Destructive Operation Safety section as MANDATORY.
- Foundation-First ordering from IDEAL plan is preserved; do not reorder.
- Language preservation: keep existing task language (EN/RU).
- No code snippets; keep to approach/steps/AC/components.
- If Story reality differs (component exists, column exists), propose Story correction to orchestrator.

## Definition of Done
- Existing tasks loaded and parsed with correct template.
- IDEAL plan vs existing compared; operations classified.
- Type validation passed for all updated/created tasks.
- Operations executed in Linear (updates, cancels, creations) with parentId intact.
- kanban_board.md updated (Backlog) with correct Epic/Story/indentation.
- Summary returned (KEEP/UPDATE/OBSOLETE/CREATE counts, URLs, warnings).
