# Implementation Task Executor

Executes a single implementation (or refactor) task from Todo to To Review using the task description and linked guides.

## Purpose & Scope
- Handle one selected task only; never touch other tasks.
- Follow task Technical Approach/plan/AC; apply KISS/YAGNI and guide patterns.
- Update Linear/kanban for this task: Todo -> In Progress -> To Review.
- Run typecheck/lint; update docs/tests/config per task instructions.
- Not for test tasks (label "tests" goes to ln-404-test-executor).

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Source | Description |
|-------|----------|--------|-------------|
| `taskId` | Yes | args, parent Story, kanban, user | Task to execute |

**Resolution:** Task Resolution Chain.
**Status filter:** Todo

## Task Storage Mode

**MANDATORY READ:** Load `shared/references/tools_config_guide.md`, `shared/references/storage_mode_detection.md`, and `shared/references/input_resolution_pattern.md`

Extract: `task_provider` = Task Management → Provider (`linear` | `file`).

| Aspect | Linear Mode | File Mode |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Load task** | `get_issue(task_id)` | `Read("docs/tasks/epics/.../tasks/T{NNN}-*.md")` |
| **Update status** | `save_issue(id, state)` | `Edit` the `**Status:**` line in file |
| **Kanban** | Updated by Linear sync | Must update `kanban_board.md` manually |

**File Mode status format:**
```markdown
## Status
**Status:** In Progress | **Priority:** High | **Estimate:** 4h
```

## Mode Detection

Detect operating mode at startup:

**Plan Mode Active:**
- Steps 1-2: Load task context (read-only, OK in plan mode)
- Generate EXECUTION PLAN (files to create/modify, approach) → write to plan file
- Call ExitPlanMode → STOP. Do NOT implement.
- Steps 3-6: After approval → execute implementation

**Normal Mode:**
- Steps 1-6: Standard workflow without stopping

## Progress Tracking with TodoWrite

When operating in any mode, skill MUST create detailed todo checklist tracking ALL steps.

**Rules:**
1. Create todos IMMEDIATELY before Step 1
2. Each workflow step = separate todo item; implementation step gets sub-items
3. Mark `in_progress` before starting step, `completed` after finishing

**Todo Template (10 items):**

```
Step 1: Resolve taskId
  - Resolve via args / Story context / kanban / AskUserQuestion (Todo filter)

Step 2: Load Context
  - Fetch full task description + linked guides/manuals/ADRs

Step 2b: Goal Articulation Gate
  - Complete 4 questions from shared/references/goal_articulation_gate.md (<=25 tokens each)

Step 3: Start Work
  - Set task to In Progress, update kanban

Step 4: Implement
  - 4a Pattern Reuse: IF creating new file/utility, Grep src/ for existing similar patterns
    (error handlers, validators, HTTP wrappers, config loaders). Reuse if found.
  - 4b Follow task plan/AC, apply KISS/YAGNI
  - 4c Architecture Guard: IF creating service function: (1) 3+ side-effect categories in **leaf** function → split (EXCEPT orchestrator functions that delegate sequentially — these are expected to have 3+ categories);
    (2) get_*/find_*/check_* naming → verify no hidden writes; (3) 3+ service imports in **leaf** function → flatten (orchestrator imports are expected)
  - Update docs and existing tests if impacted
  - Execute verify: methods from task AC (test/command/inspect)

Step 5: Quality
  - Run typecheck and lint (or project equivalents)

Step 6: Finish
  - Set task to To Review, update kanban
  - Add summary comment (changes, tests, docs)
```

## Workflow (concise)
1) **Resolve taskId** (per input_resolution_pattern.md):
   - IF args provided → use args
   - ELSE IF Story context available → list Todo tasks under Story, suggest if 1
   - ELSE IF kanban has exactly 1 Task in [Todo] → suggest
   - ELSE → AskUserQuestion: show Todo Tasks from kanban
2) **Load context:** Fetch full task description (Linear: get_issue; File: Read task file); read linked guides/manuals/ADRs/research; auto-discover team/config if needed.
2b) **Goal gate:** **MANDATORY READ:** `shared/references/goal_articulation_gate.md` — Complete the 4-question gate (<=25 tokens each). State REAL GOAL (deliverable as subject), DONE LOOKS LIKE, NOT THE GOAL, INVARIANTS & HIDDEN CONSTRAINTS.
3) **Start work:** Update this task to In Progress (Linear: update_issue; File: Edit status line); move it in kanban (keep Epic/Story indent).
4) **Implement (with verification loop):** **Before writing new utilities/handlers**, Grep `src/` for existing patterns (error handling, validation, config access). Reuse if found; if not reusable, document rationale in code comment. Follow checkboxes/plan; keep it simple; avoid hardcoded values; reuse existing components; update docs noted in Affected Components; update existing tests if impacted (no new tests here). Before creating service functions, apply Architecture Guard (cascade depth, interface honesty, flat orchestration). After implementation, execute `verify:` methods from task AC: test → run specified test; command → execute and check output; inspect → verify file/content exists. If any verify fails → fix before proceeding.
5) **Quality:** Run typecheck and lint (or project equivalents); ensure instructions in Existing Code Impact are addressed.
6) **Finish:** Mark task To Review (Linear: update_issue; File: Edit status line); update kanban to To Review; add summary comment (what changed, tests run, docs touched).

## Pre-Submission Checklist

**Context:** Self-assessment before To Review reduces review round-trips and catches obvious issues early.

Before setting To Review, verify all items:

| # | Check | Verify |
|---|-------|--------|
| 0 | **AC verified** | Each AC `verify:` method executed with pass evidence |
| 1 | **Approach alignment** | Implementation matches Story Technical Approach |
| 2 | **Clean code** | No dead code, no backward-compat shims, unused imports removed |
| 3 | **Config hygiene** | No hardcoded creds/URLs/magic numbers |
| 4 | **Docs updated** | Affected Components docs reflect changes |
| 5 | **Tests pass** | Existing tests still pass after changes |
| 6 | **Pattern reuse** | New utilities checked against existing codebase; no duplicate patterns introduced |
| 7 | **Architecture guard** | Cascade depth <= 2 (leaf functions); no hidden writes in read-named functions; no service chains >= 3 in leaf functions (orchestrator imports exempt) |
| 8 | **Destructive op safety** | If task has "Destructive Operation Safety" section: (1) backup step executed/planned before destructive code, (2) rollback mechanism exists in code, (3) environment guard present, (4) preview/dry-run evidence attached or referenced |

**MANDATORY READ:** Load `shared/references/destructive_operation_safety.md` for severity classification and safety requirements.

**HITL Gate:** IF task severity = CRITICAL (per destructive_operation_safety.md loaded above): Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm before marking To Review: "Task contains CRITICAL destructive operation: {operation}. Backup plan: {plan}. Proceed?" Do NOT mark To Review until user confirms.

**If any check fails:** Fix before setting To Review. Do not rely on reviewer to catch preventable issues.

## Critical Rules
- Single-task updates only; no bulk status changes.
- Keep language of the task (EN/RU) in edits/comments.
- No code snippets in the description; code lives in repo, not in Linear.
- No new test creation; only update existing tests if required.
- Preserve Foundation-First ordering from orchestrator; do not reorder tasks.
- **Do NOT commit.** Leave all changes uncommitted — the reviewer reviews and commits.

## Definition of Done
- Task selected and set to In Progress; kanban updated accordingly.
- Guides/manuals/ADRs/research read; approach aligned with task Technical Approach.
- Implementation completed per plan/AC; each AC `verify:` method executed with pass evidence.
- Docs and impacted tests updated.
- Typecheck and lint passed (or project quality commands) with evidence in comment.
- Task set to To Review; kanban moved to To Review; summary comment added.
