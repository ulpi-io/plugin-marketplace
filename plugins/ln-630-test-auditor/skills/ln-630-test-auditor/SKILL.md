# Test Suite Auditor (L2 Coordinator)

Coordinates comprehensive test suite audit across 6 quality categories using 5 specialized workers.

## Purpose & Scope

- **L2 Coordinator** that delegates to L3 specialized audit workers
- Audits all tests against 6 quality categories (via 5 workers)
- Calculates **Usefulness Score** for each test (Keep/Remove/Refactor)
- Identifies missing tests for critical business logic
- Detects anti-patterns and isolation issues
- Aggregates results into unified report
- Write report to `docs/project/test_audit.md` (file-based, no task creation)
- Manual invocation by user; not part of Story pipeline

## Core Philosophy

> "Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration." — Kent Beck
> "Test based on risk, not coverage." — ISO 29119

**Key Principles:**
1. **Test business logic, not frameworks** — bcrypt/Prisma/Express already tested
2. **No performance/load/stress tests** — Tests infrastructure, not code correctness (use k6/JMeter separately)
3. **Risk-based prioritization** — Priority ≥15 or remove
4. **E2E for critical paths only** — Money/Security/Data (Priority ≥20)
5. **Usefulness over quantity** — One useful test > 10 useless tests
6. **Every test must justify existence** — Impact × Probability ≥15

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery (Automated)

**Inputs:** Codebase root directory

**Actions:**
1. Find all test files using Glob:
   - `**/*.test.*` (Jest, Vitest)
   - `**/*.spec.*` (Mocha, Jasmine)
   - `**/__tests__/**/*` (Jest convention)
2. Parse test file structure (test names, assertions count)
3. Auto-discover Team ID from [docs/tasks/kanban_board.md](../docs/tasks/kanban_board.md)

**Output:** `testFilesMetadata` — list of test files with basic stats

### Phase 2: Research Best Practices (ONCE)

**Goal:** Gather testing best practices context ONCE, share with all workers

**Actions:**
1. Use MCP Ref/Context7 to research testing best practices for detected tech stack
2. Load [../shared/references/risk_based_testing_guide.md](../shared/references/risk_based_testing_guide.md)
3. Build `contextStore` with:
   - Testing philosophy (E2E primary, Unit supplementary)
   - Usefulness Score formulas (Impact × Probability)
   - Anti-patterns catalog
   - Framework detection patterns

**Add output_dir to contextStore:**
```json
{
  "output_dir": "docs/project/.audit/ln-630/{YYYY-MM-DD}"
}
```

**Output:** `contextStore` — shared context for all workers

**Key Benefit:** Context gathered ONCE → passed to all workers → token-efficient

### Phase 3: Domain Discovery

```bash
mkdir -p {output_dir}   # No deletion — date folders preserve history
```

**MANDATORY READ:** Load `shared/references/audit_coordinator_domain_mode.md`.

Detect `domain_mode` and `all_domains` with the shared pattern. This coordinator keeps one local rule: shared folders remain visible in coverage analysis, but do not inflate business-domain coverage percentages.

### Phase 4: Delegate to Workers

**MANDATORY READ:** Load `shared/references/task_delegation_pattern.md` and `shared/references/audit_worker_core_contract.md`.

#### Phase 4a: Global Workers (PARALLEL)

**Global workers** scan entire test suite (not domain-aware):

| # | Worker | Category | What It Audits |
|---|--------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | [ln-631-test-business-logic-auditor](../ln-631-test-business-logic-auditor/) | Business Logic Focus | Framework/Library tests (Prisma, Express, bcrypt, JWT, axios, React hooks) → REMOVE |
| 2 | [ln-632-test-e2e-priority-auditor](../ln-632-test-e2e-priority-auditor/) | E2E Priority | E2E baseline (2/endpoint), Pyramid validation, Missing E2E tests |
| 3 | [ln-633-test-value-auditor](../ln-633-test-value-auditor/) | Risk-Based Value | Usefulness Score = Impact × Probability<br>Decisions: ≥15 KEEP, 10-14 REVIEW, <10 REMOVE |
| 5 | [ln-635-test-isolation-auditor](../ln-635-test-isolation-auditor/) | Isolation + Anti-Patterns | Isolation (6 categories), Determinism, Anti-Patterns (7 types) |

**Invocation (4 workers in PARALLEL):**
```javascript
FOR EACH worker IN [ln-631, ln-632, ln-633, ln-635]:
  Task(description: "Test audit via " + worker,
       prompt: "Execute " + worker + ". Read skill. Context: " + JSON.stringify(contextStore),
       subagent_type: "general-purpose")
```

#### Phase 4b: Domain-Aware Worker (PARALLEL per domain)

**Domain-aware worker** runs once per domain:

| # | Worker | Category | What It Audits |
|---|--------|----------|----------------|
| 4 | [ln-634-test-coverage-auditor](../ln-634-test-coverage-auditor/) | Coverage Gaps | Missing tests for critical paths per domain (Money 20+, Security 20+, Data 15+, Core Flows 15+) |

**Invocation:**
```javascript
IF domain_mode == "domain-aware":
  FOR EACH domain IN all_domains:
    domain_context = {
      ...contextStore,
      domain_mode: "domain-aware",
      current_domain: { name: domain.name, path: domain.path }
    }
    Task(description: "Test audit coverage " + domain.name + " via ln-634",
         prompt: "Execute ln-634-test-coverage-auditor. Read skill. Context: " + JSON.stringify(domain_context),
         subagent_type: "general-purpose")
ELSE:
  // Fallback: invoke once for entire codebase (global mode)
  Task(description: "Test audit coverage via ln-634",
       prompt: "Execute ln-634-test-coverage-auditor. Read skill. Context: " + JSON.stringify(contextStore),
       subagent_type: "general-purpose")
```

**Parallelism strategy:**
- Phase 4a: All 4 global workers run in PARALLEL
- Phase 4b: All N domain-aware invocations run in PARALLEL
- Example: 3 domains → 3 ln-634 invocations in single message

**Domain-aware workers** add optional fields: `domain`, `scan_path`

### Phase 5: Aggregate Results (File-Based)

**MANDATORY READ:** Load `shared/references/audit_coordinator_aggregation.md` and `shared/references/context_validation.md`.

Use the shared aggregation pattern for output directory checks, return-value parsing, severity rollups, file reads, and final report assembly.

Local rules for this coordinator:
- Categories 1-3 and 5-6 stay global in the final report.
- Category 4 (Coverage Gaps) is grouped per domain when `domain_mode="domain-aware"`.
- Overall score = average of 5 worker scores.
- Append one results-log row with `Skill=ln-630`, `Metric=overall_score`, `Scale=0-10`.

**Context Validation (Post-Filter):**

Apply Rules 1, 5 + test-specific filters to merged findings:
```
FOR EACH finding WHERE severity IN (HIGH, MEDIUM):
  # Rule 1: ADR/Planned Override
  IF finding matches ADR → advisory "[Planned: ADR-XXX]"

  # Rule 5: Locality/Single-Consumer
  IF "extract shared helper" suggestion AND consumer_count == 1 → advisory

  # Test-specific: Custom wrapper detection
  IF "framework test" finding (ln-631) AND test imports custom wrapper class:
    → advisory (tests custom logic, not framework)

  # Test-specific: Setup/fixture code
  IF "The Liar" finding (ln-635) AND file is conftest/fixture/setup:
    → advisory (setup code, no assertions expected)

  # Test-specific: Parameterized test
  IF "The Giant" finding (ln-635) AND test is parameterized/data-driven:
    → severity -= 1 (size from data, not complexity)

Downgraded findings → "Advisory Findings" section in report.
Recalculate scores excluding advisory findings from penalty.
```

**Exempt:** Coverage gap CRITICAL findings (ln-634), risk-value scores (ln-633).

```

## Worker Architecture

Each worker:
- Receives `contextStore` with testing best practices
- Receives `testFilesMetadata` with test file list
- Loads full test file contents when analyzing
- Returns structured JSON with category findings
- Operates independently (failure in one doesn't block others)

**Token Efficiency:**
- Coordinator: metadata only (~1000 tokens)
- Workers: full test file contents when needed (~5000-10000 tokens each)
- Context gathered ONCE, shared with all workers

## Critical Rules

- **Two-stage delegation:** Global workers (4) + Domain-aware worker (ln-634 × N domains)
- **Domain discovery:** Auto-detect domains from folder structure; fallback to global mode if <2 domains
- **Parallel execution:** All workers (global + domain-aware) run in PARALLEL
- **Domain-grouped output:** Coverage Gaps findings grouped by domain (if domain_mode="domain-aware")
- **Delete > Archive:** Remove useless tests, don't comment out
- **E2E baseline:** Every endpoint needs 2 E2E (positive + negative)
- **Justify each test:** If can't explain Priority ≥15, remove it
- **Trust frameworks:** Don't test Express/Prisma/bcrypt behavior
- **No performance/load tests:** Flag and REMOVE tests measuring throughput/latency/memory (DevOps Epic territory)
- **Code is truth:** If test contradicts code behavior, update test
- **Language preservation:** Report in project's language (EN/RU)
