# Mapbox Cartography Skill

This skill provides expert cartographic knowledge to help you design effective, beautiful, and functional maps using Mapbox.

## Core Cartographic Principles

### Visual Hierarchy

Maps must guide the viewer's attention to what matters most:

- **Most important**: POIs, user location, route highlights
- **Secondary**: Major roads, city labels, landmarks
- **Tertiary**: Minor streets, administrative boundaries
- **Background**: Water, land use, terrain

**Implementation:**

- Use size, color intensity, and contrast to establish hierarchy
- Primary features: high contrast, larger symbols, bold colors
- Background features: low contrast, muted colors, smaller text

### Color Theory for Maps

**Color Harmony:**

- **Analogous colors**: Use colors next to each other on color wheel (blue-green-teal) for cohesive designs
- **Complementary colors**: Use opposite colors (blue/orange, red/green) for high contrast emphasis
- **Monochromatic**: Single hue with varying saturation/brightness for elegant, minimal designs

**Color Psychology:**

- **Blue**: Water, trust, calm, professional (default for water bodies)
- **Green**: Parks, nature, growth, eco-friendly (vegetation, parks)
- **Red/Orange**: Urgent, important, dining (alerts, restaurants)
- **Yellow**: Caution, highlight, attention (warnings, selected items)
- **Gray**: Neutral, background, roads (infrastructure)

**Accessibility:**

- Ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text (WCAG AA)
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- Test designs with colorblind simulators
- Avoid red/green combinations for critical distinctions

### Typography Best Practices

**Font Selection:**

- **Sans-serif** (Roboto, Open Sans): Modern, clean, high legibility at small sizes - use for labels
- **Serif** (Noto Serif): Traditional, formal - use sparingly for titles or historic maps
- **Monospace**: Technical data, coordinates

**Text Sizing:**

```
Place labels (cities, POIs): 11-14px
Street labels: 9-11px
Feature labels (parks): 10-12px
Map title: 16-20px
Attribution: 8-9px
```

**Label Placement:**

- Point labels: Center or slightly offset (avoid overlap with symbol)
- Line labels: Follow line curve, repeat for long features
- Area labels: Center in polygon, sized appropriately
- Prioritize: Major features get labels first, minor features labeled if space allows

### Map Context Considerations

**Know Your Audience:**

- **General public**: Simplify, use familiar patterns (Google/Apple style)
- **Technical users**: Include more detail, technical layers, data precision
- **Domain experts**: Show specialized data, use domain-specific symbology

**Use Case Optimization:**

- **Navigation**: Emphasize roads, clear hierarchy, route visibility
- **Data visualization**: Muted base map, let data stand out
- **Storytelling**: Guide viewer attention, establish mood with colors
- **Location selection**: Show POIs clearly, provide context
- **Analysis**: Include relevant layers, maintain clarity at different zooms

**Platform Considerations:**

- **Mobile**: Larger touch targets (44x44px minimum), simpler designs, readable at arm's length
- **Desktop**: Can include more detail, hover interactions, complex overlays
- **Print**: Higher contrast, larger text, consider CMYK color space
- **Outdoor/Bright**: Higher contrast, avoid subtle grays

## Mapbox-Specific Guidance

### Style Layer Best Practices

**Layer Ordering (bottom to top):**

1. Background (solid color or pattern)
2. Landuse (parks, residential, commercial)
3. Water bodies (oceans, lakes, rivers)
4. Terrain/hillshade (if using elevation)
5. Buildings (3D or 2D footprints)
6. Roads (highways → local streets)
7. Borders (country, state lines)
8. Labels (place names, street names)
9. POI symbols
10. User-generated content (routes, markers)

> **Common mistake:** Developers often put their app's route line or active markers _below_ POI symbols, reasoning that "POIs must stay visible." This is backwards — user-generated content (your route, selected location, user position) is the most important layer and must render above everything, including POIs. A route line that covers a POI icon is acceptable; a route obscured by POI icons is not.

### Zoom Level Strategy

**Zoom 0-4** (World to Continent):

- Major country boundaries
- Ocean and sea labels
- Capital cities only

**Zoom 5-8** (Country to State):

- State/province boundaries
- Major cities
- Major highways
- Large water bodies

**Zoom 9-11** (Metro Area):

- City boundaries
- Neighborhoods
- All highways and major roads
- Parks and landmarks

**Zoom 12-15** (Neighborhood):

- All streets
- Building footprints
- POIs (restaurants, shops)
- Street names

> **Note:** Mapbox's hosted Streets style defaults to showing most POIs around zoom 14. For custom styles, start POIs at zoom 12 — this is the neighborhood scale where density is manageable and users are browsing. Zoom 14 is late; zoom 10 (metro-area scale) is far too early and creates severe icon clutter.

**Zoom 16-22** (Street Level):

- All detail
- House numbers
- Parking lots
- Fine-grained POIs

### Color Palette Templates

**Light Theme (Day/Professional):**

```json
{
  "background": "#f5f5f5",
  "water": "#a0c8f0",
  "parks": "#d4e7c5",
  "roads": "#ffffff",
  "buildings": "#e0e0e0",
  "text": "#333333"
}
```

**Dark Theme (Night Mode):**

```json
{
  "background": "#1a1a1a",
  "water": "#0d47a1",
  "parks": "#2e7d32",
  "roads": "#3a3a3a",
  "buildings": "#2d2d2d",
  "text": "#ffffff"
}
```

> **Road color rule for dark themes:** Roads must use neutral dark gray (`#3a3a3a`), visibly distinct from the background but not colored. Never style roads with amber, blue, or other hues — reserve color for app data layers (routes, markers). Colored base roads and colored data layers will compete visually. Local roads that blend into the background (`#1e1e1e` on `#1a1a1a`) create a "floating labels" problem where street names appear with no visible road beneath them.

**High Contrast (Accessibility):**

```json
{
  "background": "#000000",
  "water": "#0066ff",
  "parks": "#00ff00",
  "roads": "#ffffff",
  "buildings": "#808080",
  "text": "#ffffff"
}
```

**Vintage/Retro:**

```json
{
  "background": "#f4e8d0",
  "water": "#b8d4d4",
  "parks": "#c8d4a4",
  "roads": "#d4c4a8",
  "buildings": "#e4d4c4",
  "text": "#4a3828"
}
```

## Common Mapping Scenarios

### Scenario: Restaurant Finder App

**Requirements:**

- Restaurants must be highly visible
- Street context for navigation
- Muted background (food photos overlay)

**Recommendations:**

- Use bold, warm colors for restaurant markers (red, orange)
- Gray out background (low saturation)
- Keep street labels clear but not dominant
- High contrast for selected restaurant
- Mobile-optimized touch targets

### Scenario: Real Estate Map

**Requirements:**

- Property boundaries clearly visible
- Neighborhood context
- Price differentiation

**Recommendations:**

- Use color scale for price ranges (green=affordable, red=expensive)
- Show parks and amenities prominently
- Include school zones if relevant
- Label neighborhoods clearly
- Show transit access

### Scenario: Data Visualization Overlay

**Requirements:**

- Data layer is primary focus
- Base map provides context only
- Multiple data points may cluster

**Recommendations:**

- Monochromatic, low-contrast base map
- Use data-ink ratio principle (minimize non-data elements)
- Base map grayscale or single muted hue
- Remove unnecessary labels
- Consider using light base for dark data, vice versa

### Scenario: Navigation/Routing

**Requirements:**

- Route must be unmissable
- Turn-by-turn clarity
- Current location always visible

**Recommendations:**

- Route in high-contrast color (blue or purple)
- Animate route line or use dashed pattern
- Large, clear turn indicators
- Dim unrelated features
- User location: pulsing blue dot
- Next turn: prominent arrow/icon

## Performance Optimization

**Style Performance:**

- Minimize layer count (combine similar layers)
- Use expressions instead of multiple layers for variants
- Simplify complex geometries at lower zooms
- Use sprite sheets for repeated icons
- Leverage tileset simplification

**Loading Speed:**

- Preload critical zoom levels
- Use style optimization tools
- Minimize external resource calls
- Compress images in sprite sheets

## Testing Your Design

**Checklist:**

- [ ] View at all relevant zoom levels
- [ ] Test in different lighting conditions
- [ ] Check on actual devices (mobile, desktop)
- [ ] Verify color accessibility (colorblind.org)
- [ ] Review with target users
- [ ] Test with real data density
- [ ] Check label collision/overlap
- [ ] Verify performance on slower devices

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too many colors**: Stick to 5-7 main colors maximum
2. **Insufficient contrast**: Text must be readable
3. **Overcrowding**: Not everything needs a label
4. **Ignoring zoom levels**: Show appropriate detail for scale
5. **Poor label hierarchy**: Organize by importance
6. **Inconsistent styling**: Maintain visual consistency
7. **Neglecting performance**: Complex styles slow rendering
8. **Forgetting mobile**: Test on actual devices
