# Mapbox Token Security Skill

This skill provides security expertise for managing Mapbox access tokens safely and effectively.

## Token Types and When to Use Them

### Public Tokens (pk.\*)

**Characteristics:**

- Can be safely exposed in client-side code
- Limited to specific public scopes only
- Can have URL restrictions
- Cannot access sensitive APIs

**When to use:**

- Client-side web applications
- Mobile apps
- Public-facing demos
- Embedded maps on websites

**Allowed scopes:**

- `styles:tiles` - Display style tiles (raster)
- `styles:read` - Read style specifications
- `fonts:read` - Access Mapbox fonts
- `datasets:read` - Read dataset data
- `vision:read` - Vision API access

### Secret Tokens (sk.\*)

**Characteristics:**

- **NEVER expose in client-side code**
- Full API access with any scopes
- Server-side use only
- Can create/manage other tokens

**When to use:**

- Server-side applications
- Backend services
- CI/CD pipelines
- Administrative tasks
- Token management

**Common scopes:**

- `styles:write` - Create/modify styles
- `styles:list` - List all styles
- `tokens:read` - View token information
- `tokens:write` - Create/modify tokens
- User feedback management scopes

### Temporary Tokens (tk.\*)

**Characteristics:**

- Short-lived (max 1 hour)
- Created by secret tokens
- Single-purpose use
- Automatically expire

**When to use:**

- One-time operations
- Temporary delegated access
- Short-lived demos
- Security-conscious workflows

## Scope Management Best Practices

### Principle of Least Privilege

**Always grant the minimum scopes needed:**

❌ **Bad:**

```javascript
// Overly permissive - don't do this
{
  scopes: ['styles:read', 'styles:write', 'styles:list', 'styles:delete', 'tokens:read', 'tokens:write'];
}
```

✅ **Good:**

```javascript
// Only what's needed for displaying a map
{
  scopes: ['styles:read', 'fonts:read'];
}
```

### Scope Combinations by Use Case

**Public Map Display (client-side):**

```json
{
  "scopes": ["styles:read", "fonts:read", "styles:tiles"],
  "note": "Public token for map display",
  "allowedUrls": ["https://myapp.com/*"]
}
```

**Style Management (server-side):**

```json
{
  "scopes": ["styles:read", "styles:write", "styles:list"],
  "note": "Backend style management - SECRET TOKEN"
}
```

**Token Administration (server-side):**

```json
{
  "scopes": ["tokens:read", "tokens:write"],
  "note": "Token management only - SECRET TOKEN"
}
```

**Read-Only Access:**

```json
{
  "scopes": ["styles:list", "styles:read", "tokens:read"],
  "note": "Auditing/monitoring - SECRET TOKEN"
}
```

## URL Restrictions

### Why URL Restrictions Matter

URL restrictions limit where a public token can be used, preventing unauthorized usage if the token is exposed.

### Effective URL Patterns

✅ **Recommended patterns:**

```
https://myapp.com/*           # Production domain
https://*.myapp.com/*         # All subdomains
https://staging.myapp.com/*   # Staging environment
http://localhost:*            # Local development
```

❌ **Avoid these:**

```
*                             # No restriction (insecure)
http://*                      # Any HTTP site (insecure)
*.com/*                       # Too broad
```

### Multiple Environment Strategy

Create separate tokens for each environment:

```javascript
// Production
{
  note: "Production - myapp.com",
  scopes: ["styles:read", "fonts:read"],
  allowedUrls: ["https://myapp.com/*", "https://www.myapp.com/*"]
}

// Staging
{
  note: "Staging - staging.myapp.com",
  scopes: ["styles:read", "fonts:read"],
  allowedUrls: ["https://staging.myapp.com/*"]
}

// Development
{
  note: "Development - localhost",
  scopes: ["styles:read", "fonts:read"],
  allowedUrls: ["http://localhost:*", "http://127.0.0.1:*"]
}
```

## Token Storage and Handling

### Server-Side (Secret Tokens)

✅ **DO:**

- Store in environment variables
- Use secret management services (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- Encrypt at rest
- Limit access via IAM policies
- Log token usage

❌ **DON'T:**

- Hardcode in source code
- Commit to version control
- Store in plaintext configuration files
- Share via email or Slack
- Reuse across multiple services

**Example: Secure Environment Variable:**

```bash
# .env (NEVER commit this file)
MAPBOX_SECRET_TOKEN=sk.ey...

# .gitignore (ALWAYS include .env)
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local
```

### Client-Side (Public Tokens)

✅ **DO:**

- Use public tokens only
- Apply URL restrictions
- Use different tokens per app
- Rotate periodically
- Monitor usage

❌ **DON'T:**

- Expose secret tokens
- Use tokens without URL restrictions
- Share tokens between unrelated apps
- Use tokens with excessive scopes

**Example: Safe Client Usage:**

```javascript
// Public token with URL restrictions - SAFE
const mapboxToken = 'pk.YOUR_MAPBOX_TOKEN_HERE';

// This token is restricted to your domain
// and only has styles:read scope
mapboxgl.accessToken = mapboxToken;
```

## Token Rotation Strategy

### When to Rotate Tokens

**Mandatory rotation:**

- Token exposed in public repository
- Team member leaves with token access
- Suspected compromise or breach
- Service decommissioning
- Compliance requirements

**Scheduled rotation:**

- Every 90 days (recommended for production)
- Every 30 days (high-security environments)
- After major deployments
- During security audits

### Rotation Process

**Zero-downtime rotation:**

1. **Create new token** with same scopes
2. **Deploy new token** to canary/staging environment
3. **Verify functionality** with new token
4. **Gradually roll out** to production
5. **Monitor for issues** for 24-48 hours
6. **Revoke old token** after confirmation
7. **Update documentation** with rotation date

**Emergency rotation:**

1. **Immediately revoke** compromised token
2. **Create replacement** token
3. **Deploy emergency update** to all services
4. **Notify team** of incident
5. **Investigate** how compromise occurred
6. **Update procedures** to prevent recurrence

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Track Token Usage

**Metrics to monitor:**

- API request volume per token
- Geographic distribution of requests
- Error rates by token
- Unexpected spike patterns
- Requests from unauthorized domains

**Alert on:**

- Usage from unexpected IPs/regions
- Sudden traffic spikes (>200% normal)
- High error rates (>10%)
- Requests outside allowed URLs
- Off-hours access patterns

### Regular Security Audits

**Monthly checklist:**

- [ ] Review all active tokens
- [ ] Verify token scopes are still appropriate
- [ ] Check for unused tokens (revoke if inactive >30 days)
- [ ] Confirm URL restrictions are current
- [ ] Review team member access
- [ ] Check for tokens in public repositories (GitHub scan)
- [ ] Verify documentation is up-to-date

**Quarterly checklist:**

- [ ] Rotate production tokens
- [ ] Full token inventory
- [ ] Access control review
- [ ] Update incident response procedures
- [ ] Security training for team

## Common Security Mistakes

### 1. Exposing Secret Tokens in Client Code

❌ **CRITICAL ERROR:**

```javascript
// NEVER DO THIS - Secret token in client code
const map = new mapboxgl.Map({
  accessToken: 'sk.YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN_HERE' // SECRET TOKEN
});
```

✅ **Correct:**

```javascript
// Public token only in client code
const map = new mapboxgl.Map({
  accessToken: 'pk.YOUR_PUBLIC_TOKEN_HERE' // PUBLIC TOKEN
});
```

### 2. Overly Permissive Scopes

❌ **Too broad:**

```json
{
  "scopes": ["styles:*", "tokens:*"]
}
```

✅ **Specific:**

```json
{
  "scopes": ["styles:read"]
}
```

### 3. Missing URL Restrictions

❌ **No restrictions:**

```json
{
  "scopes": ["styles:read"],
  "allowedUrls": [] // Token works anywhere
}
```

✅ **Domain restricted:**

```json
{
  "scopes": ["styles:read"],
  "allowedUrls": ["https://myapp.com/*"]
}
```

### 4. Long-Lived Tokens Without Rotation

❌ **Never rotated:**

```
Token created: Jan 2020
Last rotation: Never
Still in production: Yes
```

✅ **Regular rotation:**

```
Token created: Dec 2024
Last rotation: Dec 2024
Next rotation: Mar 2025
```

### 5. Tokens in Version Control

❌ **Committed to Git:**

```javascript
// config.js (committed to repo)
export const MAPBOX_TOKEN = 'sk.YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN_HERE';
```

✅ **Environment variables:**

```javascript
// config.js
export const MAPBOX_TOKEN = process.env.MAPBOX_SECRET_TOKEN;
```

```bash
# .env (in .gitignore)
MAPBOX_SECRET_TOKEN=sk.YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN_HERE
```

## Incident Response Plan

### If a Token is Compromised

**Immediate actions (first 15 minutes):**

1. **Revoke the token** via Mapbox dashboard or API
2. **Create replacement token** with different scopes/restrictions if needed
3. **Update all services** using the compromised token
4. **Notify team** via incident channel

**Investigation (within 24 hours):** 5. **Review access logs** to understand exposure 6. **Check for unauthorized usage** in Mapbox dashboard 7. **Identify root cause** (how was it exposed?) 8. **Document incident** with timeline and impact

**Prevention (within 1 week):** 9. **Update procedures** to prevent recurrence 10. **Implement additional safeguards** (CI checks, secret scanning) 11. **Train team** on lessons learned 12. **Update documentation** with new security measures
