## Quick Deploy

Choose the template that best fits your needs:

| **Rivet Template** | **Rivet Starter** |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| [![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/rivet?referralCode=RC7bza&utm_medium=integration&utm_source=template&utm_campaign=generic) | [![Deploy Rivet Starter](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/rivet-starter) |
| **Blank template** to start fresh | **Complete example** with chat app |
| - Rivet Engine | - Pre-configured Rivet Engine |
| - PostgreSQL database | - Example chat application with Actors |
| - Basic configuration | - PostgreSQL database |
| - Manual setup required | - Rivet Inspector for debugging |
| | - Ready to run immediately |

You can also use the [Rivet Railway template](https://github.com/rivet-dev/template-railway) as a starting point for your application.

After deploying either template, you can find the `RIVET__AUTH__ADMIN_TOKEN` under the **Variables** tab in the Railway dashboard. This token is required to access the Rivet Inspector.

## Manual Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. [Railway account](https://railway.app)
2. [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli) (optional)

### Step 1: Create New Project

# Using Railway CLI
railway init

# Or create via dashboard
# https://railway.app/new
```

### Step 2: Add Services

#### Deploy PostgreSQL Database

2. Railway automatically provisions and configures PostgreSQL
3. Note the connection string from the service variables

#### Deploy Rivet Engine

1. Click "New Service" → "Docker Image"
2. Set image: `rivetdev/engine:latest`
3. Configure environment variables:
    - `RIVET__POSTGRES__URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}`

### Step 3: Deploy Your Application

Follow the [Railway Quick Start guide](https://docs.railway.com/quick-start) to deploy your repository:

1. Connect your GitHub account to Railway
2. Select your repository containing your Rivet application
3. Railway will automatically detect and deploy your application
4. Configure environment variables for your application:
    - `RIVET_ENDPOINT=${{Rivet.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}` - Points to the Rivet Engine service's private domain
