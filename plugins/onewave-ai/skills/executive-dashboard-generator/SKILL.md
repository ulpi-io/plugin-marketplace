### Best Practices

1. **Lead with Insights, Not Data**: Start with "what this means" not "what the numbers are"
2. **Use Traffic Light System**: 🟢🟡🔴 for instant visual status
3. **Show Trends, Not Points**: Context matters more than single numbers
4. **Be Specific with Recommendations**: "Increase X by Y% using Z approach" not "Improve X"
5. **Include Forward-Looking View**: Executives care about what's coming
6. **Highlight Outliers**: Call attention to anomalies and explain them
7. **Connect to Business Goals**: Tie metrics back to strategy
8. **Keep It Scannable**: Use bullets, tables, and visual breaks

### Visualization Guidelines

**For Executives, Use**:
- ✅ Line charts (trends over time)
- ✅ Bar charts (comparisons)
- ✅ KPI cards (single metrics)
- ✅ Traffic light indicators
- ✅ Simple tables with conditional formatting

**Avoid**:
- ❌ Pie charts with >5 slices
- ❌ 3D charts
- ❌ Overly complex visualizations
- ❌ Charts without clear titles
- ❌ Confusing color schemes

### Common Use Cases

**Trigger Phrases**:
- "Turn these spreadsheets into an executive report"
- "Create a dashboard from this data"
- "Summarize this data for the board meeting"
- "Build an executive summary from these CSVs"
- "Analyze this data and provide recommendations"

**Example Request**:
> "I have 10 CSV files with sales data, marketing spend, and customer metrics from the last 6 months. Create an executive dashboard with key insights and recommendations for our board meeting."

**Response Approach**:
1. Ask clarifying questions about business context
2. Request the data files or links
3. Analyze the data for patterns and insights
4. Create comprehensive dashboard with visualizations
5. Prioritize actionable recommendations
6. Include scenario planning and risk assessment

Remember: Executives want answers to "So what?" and "What should we do?" - not raw data!
