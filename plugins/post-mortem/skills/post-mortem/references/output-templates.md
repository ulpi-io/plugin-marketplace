## Closure Integrity

| Check | Result | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Evidence Precedence | PASS/WARN/FAIL | N children resolved by commit/staged/worktree, M without evidence |
| Phantom Beads | PASS/WARN | N phantom beads detected |
| Orphaned Children | PASS/WARN | N orphans found |
| Multi-Wave Regression | PASS/FAIL | N regressions detected |
| Stretch Goals | PASS/WARN | N stretch goals closed without rationale |

### Footgun Entries (Required)

| Footgun | Trigger | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|---------|-----|
| Human CLI parsing | Automation parses human-readable CLI output instead of a structured surface such as `--json` | Parser breaks on wording/order changes or mixed prose + JSON output | Use machine-readable output for automation and treat prose output as display-only |
| Hook git env leakage | Hook/helper shell inherits `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, or `GIT_COMMON_DIR` from another repo/worktree | Git resolves the wrong repo or reports misleading dirty-state evidence | Unset git discovery env before repo resolution, then rerun git from the intended cwd |

## Next Work

| 1 | <title> | tech-debt / improvement / pattern-fix / process-improvement | high / medium / low | council-finding / retro-learning / retro-pattern | <repo-name or *> |

### Recommended Next /rpi
/rpi "<highest-value improvement>"

## Status

[ ] CLOSED - Work complete, learnings captured
[ ] FOLLOW-UP - Issues need addressing (create new beads)
```

Notes:

- Populate `## Next Work` before `### Recommended Next /rpi`. The suggestion must come from harvested items, not pre-harvest speculation.
- If no items are harvested, keep the report explicit: `Flywheel stable - no follow-up items identified.`
- Footgun entries are not optional flavor text. They are harvest inputs for `pattern-fix` items when the cycle discovered real operator/runtime gotchas.
- Evidence-only or pre-commit closure packets must preserve the durable tracked copy at `.agents/releases/evidence-only-closures/<target-id>.json`. The writer also emits a local council copy at `.agents/council/evidence-only-closures/<target-id>.json`.

Example evidence-only closure packet:

```json
{
  "repo_state": {
    "repo_root": "."
  }
}
```

## Evidence-Only Closure Artifact

When a post-mortem closes an item on validation or policy evidence without a
code diff, write a proof artifact to
`.agents/council/evidence-only-closures/<target-id>.json`.

Example producer command:

```bash
bash skills/post-mortem/scripts/write-evidence-only-closure.sh \
  --target-id na-a7e.4 \
  --target-type issue \
  --producer post-mortem \
  --evidence-mode auto \
  --validation-command "bash tests/hooks/lib-hook-helpers.bats" \
  --evidence-summary "Structured proof artifact added and schema validation passed." \
  --artifact ".agents/council/2026-03-09-post-mortem-na-a7e.md"
```

Template shape:

```json
{
  "$schema": "../../../schemas/evidence-only-closure.v1.schema.json",
  "schema_version": 1,
  "artifact_id": "evidence-only-closure-<target-id>",
  "target_id": "<target-id>",
  "target_type": "issue",
  "created_at": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
  "producer": "post-mortem",
  "evidence_mode": "commit|staged|worktree",
  "validation_commands": ["bash <command>"],
  "repo_state": {
    "repo_root": "/abs/path/to/repo",
    "git_branch": "main",
    "git_dirty": true,
    "head_sha": "<sha>",
    "modified_files": [],
    "staged_files": [],
    "unstaged_files": [],
    "untracked_files": []
  },
  "evidence": {
    "summary": "<why evidence-only closure is valid>",
    "artifacts": ["<supporting-path>"],
    "notes": ["<optional note>"]
  }
}
```

Mode guidance:

- `commit`: commit-backed evidence exists and wins for the closed item
- `staged`: no qualifying commit evidence exists, but the scoped files are staged
- `worktree`: neither commit nor staged evidence exists, but qualifying unstaged or untracked files exist

`auto` is only the selection input to the writer script. The emitted artifact must
record the resolved mode.
