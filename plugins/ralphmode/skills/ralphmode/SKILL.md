# Ralphmode

Ralphmode is a cross-platform permission profile for long-running `ralph` or `jeo` workflows.
It reduces approval friction, but it is not "allow everything everywhere."
The core rule is simple: widen automation only inside a bounded project or disposable sandbox, and keep secrets plus destructive commands explicitly blocked.

## When to use this skill

- You want `ralph` to iterate without repeated approval popups.
- You are setting up the same repo for Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI.
- You need a shared safety model: repo-only writes, no secrets reads, no destructive shell by default.
- You want a stronger separation between day-to-day automation and true YOLO mode.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Define the automation boundary first

Before changing any permission mode:

- Pick one project root and keep automation scoped there.
- List files and commands that must stay blocked: `.env*`, `secrets/**`, production credentials, `rm -rf`, `sudo`, unchecked `curl | sh`.
- Decide whether this is a normal repo or a disposable sandbox.

If the answer is "disposable sandbox," you may use the platform's highest-autonomy mode.
If not, use the repo-scoped preset instead.

### Step 2: Choose one preset per platform

Use only the section that matches the current tool:

- Claude Code: everyday preset first, `bypassPermissions` only for isolated sandboxes.
- Codex CLI: use the current official approval and sandbox model first; treat older `permissions.allow` and `permissions.deny` snippets as compatibility-only.
- Gemini CLI: trust only the project root; there is no true global YOLO mode.

Detailed templates live in [references/permission-profiles.md](./references/permission-profiles.md).

### Step 3: Apply the profile locally, not globally, unless the workspace is disposable

Prefer project-local configuration over user-global defaults.

- Claude Code: start with project `.claude/settings.json`.
- Codex CLI: start with project config and repo instructions or rules files.
- Gemini CLI: trust the current folder, not `~/` or broad parent directories.

If you must use a user-global default, pair it with a stricter denylist and a sandbox boundary.

### Step 4: Run Ralph with an explicit verification loop

After permissions are configured:

1. Confirm the task and acceptance criteria.
2. Run `ralph` or the `jeo` plan-execute-verify loop.
3. Verify outputs before claiming completion.
4. If the automation profile was temporary, revert it after the run.

Recommended execution contract:

```text
boundary check -> permission profile -> ralph run -> verify -> cleanup or revert
```

### Step 5: Keep "skip" and "safe" separate

Treat these as different modes:

- Repo automation: minimal prompts inside a bounded workspace.
- Sandbox YOLO: promptless execution in a disposable environment only.

Do not collapse them into one shared team default.

### Step 6: Configure Mid-Execution Approval Checkpoints

Static permission profiles (Steps 2–3) reduce friction before a run starts, but they do not stop dangerous operations that arise during execution. Add dynamic checkpoints so that Tier 1 actions are blocked or flagged at the moment they are attempted.

#### Dangerous operation tiers

| Tier | Action | Platform response |
|------|--------|------------------|
| **Tier 1** (always block) | `rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`, `DROP TABLE`, `sudo`, `.env*`/`secrets/**` access, production environment changes | Block immediately, require explicit user approval |
| **Tier 2** (warn) | `npm publish`, `docker push`, `git push` (non-force), DB migrations | Output warning, continue only with confirmation |
| **Tier 3** (allow) | File reads/edits, tests, local builds, lint | Allow automatically |

#### Platform checkpoint mechanisms

| Platform | Hook | Blocking | Recommended pattern |
|----------|------|----------|-------------------|
| Claude Code | `PreToolUse` (Bash) | Yes — exit 2 | Shell script pattern-matches command; blocks Tier 1 |
| Gemini CLI | `BeforeTool` | Yes — non-zero exit | Shell script blocks tool; stderr fed to next turn |
| Codex CLI | `notify` (post-turn) | No | `approval_policy="unless-allow-listed"` + prompt contract |
| OpenCode | None | No | Prompt contract in `opencode.json` instructions |

**Principle**: Combine static profiles (Steps 2–3) with dynamic checkpoints (this step).
- Platforms with pre-tool hooks (Claude Code, Gemini): use the hook script.
- Platforms without (Codex, OpenCode): rely on `approval_policy` and explicit prompt contracts that instruct the agent to output `CHECKPOINT_NEEDED: <reason>` and wait before proceeding with Tier 1 actions.

See [references/permission-profiles.md](./references/permission-profiles.md) for full hook script templates per platform.

## Examples

### Example 1: Claude Code sandbox run

Use the Claude sandbox preset from [references/permission-profiles.md](./references/permission-profiles.md), then run Ralph only inside that isolated repo:

```bash
/ralph "fix all failing tests" --max-iterations=10
```

### Example 2: Codex CLI sandbox Ralph run

For sandbox ralph runs, use the CLI flags directly:

```bash
codex -c model_reasoning_effort="high" --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox -c model_reasoning_summary="detailed" -c model_supports_reasoning_summaries=true
```

For repo-scoped (non-sandbox) runs, use the config file approach from [references/permission-profiles.md](./references/permission-profiles.md):

```toml
approval_policy = "never"
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"
```

Place this in `~/.codex/config.toml` (or a project-local override) and restart Codex before running Ralph.

### Example 3: Gemini CLI sandbox or trust-only setup

For sandbox ralph runs, use `--yolo` mode:

```bash
gemini --yolo
```

For normal repo automation, trust the current project folder with explicit file selection and run the Ralph workflow for that repo only. See [references/permission-profiles.md](./references/permission-profiles.md) for details.

## Best practices

- Default to the least-permissive preset that still lets Ralph finish end-to-end.
- Keep secret denylists and destructive command denylists even when approvals are reduced.
- Use full bypass only in disposable environments with a clear project boundary.
- Record which preset was applied so teammates can reproduce or revert it.
- Re-check platform docs when upgrading CLI versions because permission models change faster than skill content.
