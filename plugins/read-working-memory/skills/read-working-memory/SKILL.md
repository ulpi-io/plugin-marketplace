# Read Working Memory

> Start every session with context. Your Working Memory is a daily briefing synthesized from your knowledge base.

## When to Use

**At session start:**

- Beginning of a new conversation
- Returning to a project after a break
- When context about recent work would help

**During session:**

- User asks "what am I working on?" or "what's my context?"
- User references recent priorities or decisions
- Need to understand what's been happening across tools

**Skip when:**

- Already loaded this session
- User explicitly wants a fresh start
- Working on an isolated, context-independent task

## Usage

Read Working Memory with `nmem` first:

```bash
nmem --json wm read
```

If it succeeds but reports `exists: false`, say there is no Working Memory briefing yet. Only fall back to `~/ai-now/memory.md` for older local-only setups.

### What You'll Find

The Working Memory briefing contains:

- **Active Focus Areas** — Topics you're currently engaged with, ranked by recent activity
- **Priorities** — Items flagged as important or needing attention
- **Unresolved Flags** — Contradictions, stale information, or items needing verification
- **Recent Activity** — What changed in your knowledge base since the last briefing
- **Deep Links** — References to specific memories for further exploration

### How to Use This Context

1. **Read once at session start** — don't re-read unless asked
2. **Reference naturally** — mention relevant context when it connects to the current task
3. **Don't overwhelm** — share only the parts relevant to what the user is working on
4. **Cross-tool continuity** — insights saved in other tools (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex) appear here

## Examples

```bash
# Read today's briefing
nmem --json wm read

# Legacy local-only fallback
test -f ~/ai-now/memory.md && cat ~/ai-now/memory.md || echo "No Working Memory found. Ensure Nowledge Mem is running with Background Intelligence enabled."
```

## About Working Memory

Working Memory is generated daily by Nowledge Mem's Background Intelligence. It synthesizes your recent knowledge activity into a concise briefing that any connected AI tool can read.

**Updated daily** at your configured briefing time (default: 8 AM local time).

**Shared across tools** — the same file is read by Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and any other connected agent. Save an insight in one tool, and tomorrow's briefing reflects it for all tools.
