# Skill Tests

Tests for design-skills. Run scenarios WITH and WITHOUT skills loaded to verify they provide value.

## How to Run Tests

For each scenario:
1. **Baseline (RED):** Run with a subagent that does NOT have the skill loaded
2. **With Skill (GREEN):** Run with a subagent that HAS the skill loaded
3. **Compare:** Document differences in behavior

---

### Test 17: State Management

**Expected without skill:** May suggest `disabled={true}` with a custom spinner.

---

### Test 18: Server vs Client Boundary

**Prompt:**
```
I need a card with a heading, text, and a button that opens a dialog. Which parts need 'use client'?
```

**Expected with skill:** Only Dialog interaction needs `'use client'`. Card, Heading, Text, Button are server-safe. Extract Dialog into small client component.

**Expected without skill:** May add `'use client'` to the entire file.

---

### Test 19: Full Page Scenario

**Prompt:**
```
Build a settings form with a title, description, email text field with validation, a toggle switch, and save/cancel buttons using Resend's design system.
```

**Expected with skill:**
- `Heading` for title, `Text` for description

- `Switch` for toggle
- `Button appearance="white"` for save, `Button appearance="fade"` for cancel
- Correct imports from `@/ui/*`

---

### Test 20: TextField Validation Error

```

**Expected with skill:**
- `TextField.Input` gets `state="invalid"`
- `TextField.Error` is placed inside a trailing `TextField.Slot`
- Does NOT also pass `error=` prop on Input or manually set `aria-describedby`

**Expected without skill:** May use a `<p>` below the input, miss `state="invalid"`, or wire aria-describedby manually.

---

### Test 21: TextField Read-Only State

**Prompt:**
```
How do I make a TextField read-only in Resend?
```

**Expected with skill:** `state="read-only"` on `TextField.Input`, not `readOnly={true}`.

**Expected without skill:** May use HTML `readOnly` attribute or `disabled`.

---

### Test 22: Banner vs Tag

**Prompt:**
```
I need to show a "Your account is suspended" warning in Resend. Should I use a Banner or a Tag?
```

**Expected with skill:** Banner — it's for page/section-level messages with `role="alert"`, auto icon, `appearance="red"` for error state. Tag is for inline labels on items (status, category).

**Expected without skill:** May guess either without explaining the distinction.

---

### Test 23: DropdownMenu vs Select

**Prompt:**
```
I need a button that opens a menu with "Edit", "Duplicate", and "Delete" actions. Should I use Select or DropdownMenu?
```

**Expected with skill:** DropdownMenu — Select is for choosing a value (form input). DropdownMenu is for action menus. Uses `import * as DropdownMenu from '@/ui/dropdown-menu'`.

**Expected without skill:** May use Select incorrectly or not know the distinction.

---

### Test 24: Dialog Button Appearances

**Prompt:**
```
A dialog asks the user to confirm deleting an item. Write the dialog with appropriate button appearances for the confirm and cancel actions.
```

**Expected with skill:**
- Delete/confirm button: `appearance="red"` (destructive)
- Cancel button: `appearance="fade"` or `appearance="gray"` (secondary)
- Knows the color convention: white=primary, gray=secondary, fade=ghost, red=destructive

**Expected without skill:** May use `variant="destructive"` / `variant="outline"`, or guess wrong appearances.

---

### Test 25: Submit Button Loading

**Prompt:**
```
A form submit button should show a spinner and prevent re-submission while the form is saving. How do you implement this in Resend?
```

**Expected with skill:** `state={isSaving ? "loading" : "normal"}` on Button — a single prop handles both the spinner and non-interactivity. Does NOT use `disabled={isSaving}` + separate spinner component.

**Expected without skill:** Uses `disabled={isLoading}` with a custom loading indicator alongside.

---

### Test 26: Complex Server/Client Split

**Prompt:**
```
A page shows a list of API keys fetched server-side. Each row has a 'Revoke' button that opens a confirmation dialog. How do you structure the 'use client' boundaries?
```

**Expected with skill:**
- Page component + list rendering stay as Server Components
- Extract `<RevokeDialog />` per row as a small Client Component (`'use client'`)
- Button and list items are server-safe; only Dialog interaction needs client boundary

**Expected without skill:** May mark entire page or list component as `'use client'`.

---

### Test 27: Primary vs Secondary Button Appearances

**Prompt:**
```
A form has a 'Save changes' button (primary action) and a 'Discard' button (secondary/ghost). Which appearance should each use in Resend?
```

**Expected with skill:**
- Save: `appearance="white"` (primary — inverted black/white, flips in dark mode)
- Discard: `appearance="fade"` or `appearance="fade-gray"` (ghost/subtle)

**Expected without skill:** May use `variant="primary"` / `variant="outline"`, or mix up which appearance maps to which role.

---

### Test 28: CVA Appearance vs State Naming

**Prompt:**
```
Create a notification badge with 'success', 'warning', and 'error' visual styles following Resend's CVA conventions. What prop name should control the visual style?
```

**Expected with skill:**
- Uses `appearance` prop (not `variant`, `type`, or `state`) for visual styles
- `state` is reserved for interactive states (disabled, loading) — not for visual variants
- CVA: `variants: { appearance: { success: '...', warning: '...', error: '...' } }`

**Expected without skill:** May use `state`, `variant`, or `type` instead of `appearance`.
