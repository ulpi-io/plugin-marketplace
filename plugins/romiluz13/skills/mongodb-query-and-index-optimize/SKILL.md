# MongoDB Query and Index Optimization

Query patterns and indexing strategies for MongoDB, maintained by MongoDB. Contains **46 rules across 5 categories**, prioritized by impact. Includes MongoDB 8.0 features: `bulkWrite` command, `$queryStats` (introduced in MongoDB 6.0.7, with 8.1/8.2 enhancements), Query Settings, and `updateOne` sort option. Indexes are the primary tool for query performance—most slow queries are missing an appropriate index.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Writing new MongoDB queries or aggregations
- Creating or reviewing indexes for collections
- Debugging slow queries (COLLSCAN, high execution time)
- Reviewing explain() output
- Seeing Performance Advisor suggestions
- Optimizing aggregation pipelines
- Implementing built-in `$text` search with text indexes
- Adding geospatial queries
- Setting up TTL (time-to-live) for data expiration
- Analyzing index usage with $indexStats
- Profiling slow operations

Use `mongodb-search` instead when the request is about Atlas Search, `$search`, `$searchMeta`, analyzers, synonyms, autocomplete, or search-specific relevance tuning on Atlas-hosted data.

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix | Rules |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Index Essentials | CRITICAL | `index-` | 9 |
| 2 | Specialized Indexes | HIGH | `index-` | 11 |
| 3 | Query Patterns | HIGH | `query-` | 10 |
| 4 | Aggregation Optimization | HIGH | `agg-` | 8 |
| 5 | Performance Diagnostics | MEDIUM | `perf-` | 8 |

## Quick Reference

- `query-updateone-sort` - MongoDB 8.0 deterministic updates with sort option

### 4. Aggregation Optimization (HIGH) - 8 rules

- `agg-match-early` - Filter with $match at pipeline start
- `agg-project-early` - Reduce document size with $project
- `agg-sort-limit` - Combine $sort with $limit for top-N
- `agg-lookup-index` - Ensure $lookup foreign field is indexed
- `agg-graphlookup` - Use $graphLookup for recursive graph traversal
- `agg-avoid-large-unwind` - Don't $unwind massive arrays
- `agg-allowdiskuse` - Handle large aggregations exceeding 100MB
- `agg-group-memory-limit` - Control $group memory and spills

### 5. Performance Diagnostics (MEDIUM) - 8 rules

- `perf-explain-interpretation` - Read explain() output like a pro
- `perf-slow-query-log` - Use profiler to find slow operations
- `perf-index-stats` - Find unused indexes with $indexStats
- `perf-query-plan-cache` - Understand and manage query plan cache
- `perf-use-hint` - Force a known-good index when the optimizer errs
- `perf-atlas-performance-advisor` - Use Atlas suggestions for missing indexes
- `perf-query-stats` - Workload-based query analysis with $queryStats (introduced in MongoDB 6.0.7, with 8.1/8.2 enhancements)
- `perf-query-settings` - MongoDB 8.0 persistent index hints with setQuerySettings

## Key Principle

> **"If there's no index, it's a collection scan."**

Every query without a supporting index scans the entire collection. A 10ms query on 10,000 documents becomes a 10-second query on 10 million documents.

## ESR Rule (Equality-Sort-Range)

The most important rule for compound index field order:

```javascript
// Query: status = "active" AND createdAt > lastWeek ORDER BY priority
// ESR: Equality (status) → Sort (priority) → Range (createdAt)
db.tasks.createIndex({ status: 1, priority: 1, createdAt: 1 })
```

| Position | Type | Example | Why |
|----------|------|---------|-----|
| First | Equality | `status: "active"` | Narrows to exact matches |
| Second | Sort | `ORDER BY priority` | Avoids in-memory sort |
| Third | Range | `createdAt > date` | Scans within sorted data |

> ERS Exception: When range predicate is highly selective, placing Range before Sort reduces sort input. Verify with explain().

## How to Use

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples:

```
rules/index-compound-field-order.md
rules/perf-explain-interpretation.md
rules/_sections.md
```

Each rule file contains:
- Brief explanation of why it matters
- Incorrect code example with explanation
- Correct code example with explanation
- "When NOT to use" exceptions
- How to verify with explain()
- Performance impact and metrics

## How These Rules Work

### Recommendations with Verification

Every rule in this skill provides:
1. **A recommendation** based on best practices
2. **A verification checklist** of things that should be confirmed
3. **Commands to verify** so you can check before implementing
4. **MCP integration** for automatic verification when connected

### Why Verification Matters

I analyze code patterns, but I can't see your actual database without a connection.
This means I might suggest:
- Creating an index that already exists
- Optimizing a query that's already using an efficient index
- Adding a compound index when a prefix already covers the query

**Always verify before implementing.** Each rule includes verification commands.

### MongoDB MCP Integration

For automatic verification, connect the [MongoDB MCP Server](https://github.com/mongodb-js/mongodb-mcp-server):

**Option 1: Connection String**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mongodb": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mongodb-mcp-server", "--readOnly"],
      "env": {
        "MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING": "mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/mydb"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Option 2: Local MongoDB**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mongodb": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mongodb-mcp-server", "--readOnly"],
      "env": {
        "MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING": "mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**⚠️ Security**: Use `--readOnly` for safety. Remove only if you need write operations.

When connected, I can automatically:
- Check existing indexes via `mcp__mongodb__collection-indexes`
- Analyze query performance via `mcp__mongodb__explain`
- Verify data patterns via `mcp__mongodb__aggregate`

### ⚠️ Action Policy

**I will NEVER execute write operations without your explicit approval.**

| Operation Type | MCP Tools | Action |
|---------------|-----------|--------|
| **Read (Safe)** | `find`, `aggregate`, `explain`, `collection-indexes`, `$indexStats` | I may run automatically to verify |
| **Write (Requires Approval)** | `create-index`, `drop-index`, `update-many`, `delete-many` | I will show the command and wait for your "yes" |
| **Destructive (Requires Approval)** | `drop-collection`, `drop-database` | I will warn you and require explicit confirmation |

When I recommend creating an index or making changes:
1. I'll explain **what** I want to do and **why**
2. I'll show you the **exact command**
3. I'll **wait for your approval** before executing
4. If you say "go ahead" or "yes", only then will I run it

**Your database, your decision.** I'm here to advise, not to act unilaterally.

### Working Together

If you're not sure about a recommendation:
1. Run the verification commands I provide
2. Share the output with me
3. I'll adjust my recommendation based on your actual data

We're a team—let's get this right together.
