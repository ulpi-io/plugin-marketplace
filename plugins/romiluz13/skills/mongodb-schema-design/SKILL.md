# MongoDB Schema Design

Data modeling patterns and anti-patterns for MongoDB, maintained by MongoDB. Contains **33 rules across 5 categories**, prioritized by impact. Bad schema is the root cause of most MongoDB performance and cost issues—queries and indexes cannot fix a fundamentally wrong model.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Designing a new MongoDB schema from scratch
- Migrating from SQL/relational databases to MongoDB
- Reviewing existing data models for performance issues
- Troubleshooting slow queries or growing document sizes
- Deciding between embedding and referencing
- Modeling relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
- Implementing tree/hierarchical structures
- Seeing Atlas Schema Suggestions or Performance Advisor warnings
- Hitting the 16MB document limit
- Adding schema validation to existing collections

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix | Rules |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Schema Anti-Patterns | CRITICAL | `antipattern-` | 7 |
| 2 | Schema Fundamentals | HIGH | `fundamental-` | 5 |
| 3 | Relationship Patterns | HIGH | `relationship-` | 6 |
| 4 | Design Patterns | MEDIUM | `pattern-` | 12 |
| 5 | Schema Validation | MEDIUM | `validation-` | 3 |

## Quick Reference

### 1. Schema Anti-Patterns (CRITICAL) - 7 rules

- `antipattern-unbounded-arrays` - Never allow arrays to grow without limit
- `antipattern-bloated-documents` - Keep documents under 16KB for working set
- `antipattern-massive-arrays` - Arrays over 1000 elements hurt performance
- `antipattern-unnecessary-collections` - Fewer collections, more embedding
- `antipattern-excessive-lookups` - Reduce $lookup by denormalizing
- `antipattern-schema-drift` - Enforce consistent structure across documents
- `antipattern-unnecessary-indexes` - Audit and remove unused or redundant indexes

### 2. Schema Fundamentals (HIGH) - 5 rules

- `fundamental-embed-vs-reference` - Decision framework for relationships
- `fundamental-data-together` - Data accessed together stored together
- `fundamental-document-model` - Embrace documents, avoid SQL patterns
- `fundamental-schema-validation` - Enforce structure with JSON Schema
- `fundamental-16mb-awareness` - Design around BSON document limit

### 3. Relationship Patterns (HIGH) - 6 rules

- `relationship-one-to-one` - Embed for simplicity, reference for independence
- `relationship-one-to-few` - Embed bounded arrays (addresses, phone numbers)
- `relationship-one-to-many` - Reference for large/unbounded relationships
- `relationship-one-to-squillions` - Reference massive child sets, store summaries
- `relationship-many-to-many` - Two-way referencing for bidirectional access
- `relationship-tree-structures` - Parent/child/materialized path patterns

### 4. Design Patterns (MEDIUM) - 12 rules

- `pattern-archive` - Move historical data to separate storage for performance
- `pattern-attribute` - Collapse many optional fields into key-value attributes
- `pattern-bucket` - Group time-series or IoT data into buckets
- `pattern-time-series-collections` - Use native time series collections when available
- `pattern-extended-reference` - Cache frequently-accessed related data
- `pattern-subset` - Store hot data in main doc, cold data elsewhere
- `pattern-computed` - Pre-calculate expensive aggregations
- `pattern-outlier` - Handle documents with exceptional array sizes
- `pattern-polymorphic` - Store heterogeneous documents with a type discriminator
- `pattern-schema-versioning` - Evolve schemas safely with version fields

### 5. Schema Validation (MEDIUM) - 3 rules

- `validation-json-schema` - Validate data types and structure at database level
- `validation-action-levels` - Choose warn vs error mode for validation
- `validation-rollout-strategy` - Introduce validation safely in production

## Key Principle

> **"Data that is accessed together should be stored together."**

This is MongoDB's core philosophy. Embedding related data eliminates joins, reduces round trips, and enables atomic updates. Reference only when you must.

## Decision Framework

| Relationship | Cardinality | Access Pattern | Recommendation |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| One-to-One | 1:1 | Always together | Embed |
| One-to-Few | 1:N (N < 100) | Usually together | Embed array |
| One-to-Many | 1:N (N > 100) | Often separate | Reference |
| Many-to-Many | M:N | Varies | Two-way reference |

## How to Use

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples:

```
rules/antipattern-unbounded-arrays.md
rules/relationship-one-to-many.md
rules/_sections.md
```

Each rule file contains:
- Brief explanation of why it matters
- Incorrect code example with explanation
- Correct code example with explanation
- "When NOT to use" exceptions
- Performance impact and metrics
- Verification diagnostics

## How These Rules Work

### Recommendations with Verification

Every rule in this skill provides:
1. **A recommendation** based on best practices
2. **A verification checklist** of things that should be confirmed
3. **Commands to verify** so you can check before implementing
4. **MCP integration** for automatic verification when connected

### Why Verification Matters

I analyze code patterns, but I can't see your actual data without a database connection.
This means I might suggest:
- Fixing an "unbounded array" that's actually small and bounded
- Restructuring a schema that works well for your access patterns
- Adding validation when documents already conform to the schema

**Always verify before implementing.** Each rule includes verification commands.

### MongoDB MCP Integration

For automatic verification, connect the [MongoDB MCP Server](https://github.com/mongodb-js/mongodb-mcp-server):

**Option 1: Connection String**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mongodb": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mongodb-mcp-server", "--readOnly"],
      "env": {
        "MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING": "mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/mydb"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Option 2: Local MongoDB**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mongodb": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mongodb-mcp-server", "--readOnly"],
      "env": {
        "MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING": "mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**⚠️ Security**: Use `--readOnly` for safety. Remove only if you need write operations.

When connected, I can automatically:
- Infer schema via `mcp__mongodb__collection-schema`
- Measure document/array sizes via `mcp__mongodb__aggregate`
- Check collection statistics via `mcp__mongodb__db-stats`

### ⚠️ Action Policy

**I will NEVER execute write operations without your explicit approval.**

| Operation Type | MCP Tools | Action |
|---------------|-----------|--------|
| **Read (Safe)** | `find`, `aggregate`, `collection-schema`, `db-stats`, `count` | I may run automatically to verify |
| **Write (Requires Approval)** | `update-many`, `insert-many`, `create-collection` | I will show the command and wait for your "yes" |
| **Destructive (Requires Approval)** | `delete-many`, `drop-collection`, `drop-database` | I will warn you and require explicit confirmation |

When I recommend schema changes or data modifications:
1. I'll explain **what** I want to do and **why**
2. I'll show you the **exact command**
3. I'll **wait for your approval** before executing
4. If you say "go ahead" or "yes", only then will I run it

**Your database, your decision.** I'm here to advise, not to act unilaterally.

### Working Together

If you're not sure about a recommendation:
1. Run the verification commands I provide
2. Share the output with me
3. I'll adjust my recommendation based on your actual data

We're a team—let's get this right together.
