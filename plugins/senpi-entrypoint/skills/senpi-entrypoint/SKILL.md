# Senpi Agent Entrypoint

Onboard an AI agent into the Senpi trading platform on Hyperliquid via
modular skills: account setup, skill discovery, and trading strategies.

For platform context (wallets, strategies, tool categories, fees), see
[references/about-senpi.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills/refs/heads/main/senpi-entrypoint/references/about-senpi.md).


If any `npx` command fails, consult
[references/error-handling.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills/refs/heads/main/senpi-entrypoint/references/error-handling.md) for recovery
steps.

## Environment Variable Defaults

| Variable | Placeholder | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `SENPI_MCP_ENDPOINT` | `{{SENPI_MCP_ENDPOINT}}` | `https://mcp.prod.senpi.ai` |
| `REFERRAL_CODE` | `{{REFERRAL_CODE}}` | _(empty — optional)_ |

If a placeholder appears as a literal `{{...}}` string (not substituted),
use the default value from the table above.

---

## Agent Behavior

Do not narrate or explain tool calls. Execute silently and only present final results to the user.

---

## Pre-Response Check (Run Every Time This Skill Is Invoked)

Before responding to any query in this skill, run the mandatory invocation
check in
[references/skill-update-checker.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills/refs/heads/main/senpi-entrypoint/references/skill-update-checker.md)
(`Pre-Response Invocation Check` section) exactly once per invocation, then
reuse the captured `UPDATE_OUTPUT` for all downstream response contracts.
Do not run the same check a second time in the same invocation.

---

## Initial check: Skip only Step 1 if already authenticated

Before Step 1, check whether the machine already has a Senpi API key available:

```bash
if [ -n "${SENPI_AUTH_TOKEN}" ]; then
  # Optional: verify MCP responds (e.g. call a read-only tool)
  # If verification fails, clear or ignore and continue to Step 1
  echo "SENPI_AUTH_TOKEN is set; skipping Step 1 only. You MUST still run Step 2, then Step 3, then Step 4."
  SKIP_ONBOARDING=true
else
  SKIP_ONBOARDING=false
fi
```

- **If `SENPI_AUTH_TOKEN` is set and (optionally) MCP responds:** Skip **only Step 1** (Onboard). You **MUST** still run **Step 2: Discover** (list skills and present the catalog to the user), then **Step 3: Guide**, then **Step 4: Expand**. Do not treat "token is set" as "onboarding complete — do nothing."
- **If `SENPI_AUTH_TOKEN` is unset or empty:** Proceed to **Step 1: Onboard** as usual.

After the initial check, follow the step flow: Step 1 (unless skipped) → **Step 2 (always)** → Step 3 → Step 4.

---

## Step 1: Onboard

**Run this step only when** `SENPI_AUTH_TOKEN` is not set (i.e. `SKIP_ONBOARDING` is false). If you skipped here from the initial check, go to Step 2.

Install the onboarding skill:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills --skill senpi-onboard -g -y
```

Load and follow the `senpi-onboard` skill instructions. Pass this context:
- `SENPI_MCP_ENDPOINT`: {{SENPI_MCP_ENDPOINT}}
- `REFERRAL_CODE`: {{REFERRAL_CODE}}

**Gate — verify before proceeding:**
1. Senpi account exists
2. API key is generated
3. MCP server is configured and responds to a tool call

---

## Step 2: Discover

**Run this step always:** after Step 1 completes, or immediately when the initial check found `SENPI_AUTH_TOKEN` set. Do not skip this step when the user already has a token — they still need to see the skill catalog.

List available trading skills:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills --list
```

Present the catalog to the user. If the command fails, point the user to the
official [Senpi Skills repository](https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills)
to browse available skills.

**Gate — verify before proceeding:** User has seen the skill catalog.

---

## Step 2.5: Check Funding Status

**Run this step always**, after Step 2 and before Step 3. Call `account_get_portfolio` to fetch the user's current balance. Do this silently — do not narrate the tool call.

- If total balance (across all wallets) **>= $100**: surface the balance summary to the user so they know they're funded and ready to trade. Proceed to Step 3.
- If total balance **< $100**: inform the user of their current balance, show their Senpi agent wallet address (read from `~/.config/senpi/state.json` → `account.agentWalletAddress` or `wallet.address`), and note that at least $100 USDC is required to start trading. Mention supported chains: Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Ethereum. Still proceed to Step 3.
- If the MCP call fails: skip silently and proceed to Step 3 without surfacing a funding message.

---

## Step 3: Guide (Optional)

Ask the user:

> "Would you like to learn how to trade on Senpi? I can walk you through
> your first trade with an interactive guide."

If the user agrees, install the Senpi getting started guide:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills --skill senpi-getting-started-guide -g -y
```

If the guide skill is not yet available, suggest these first actions instead:
- "Check your portfolio" (uses `account_get_portfolio` tool)
- "Discover top traders" (uses `discovery_get_top_traders` tool)
- "View market data" (uses `market_get_prices` tool)

---

## Step 4: Expand (User-Driven)

Install additional trading skills on demand based on user interest:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills --skill <skill-name> -g -y
```

Example:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills --skill wolf-strategy -g -y
```

Onboarding is complete. The agent is now equipped with Senpi's trading
toolkit and can install more skills as needed.

---

## Step 5: Install Background Skill Update Checker

Agent behaviour for this step: see
[references/skill-update-checker.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills/refs/heads/main/senpi-entrypoint/references/skill-update-checker.md)
(§ "Step 5 Agent Behaviour").

Run this step after Step 4 completes. It registers a daily **OpenClaw cron**
job that runs the skill update checker in an isolated session with no
delivery; the agent runs the script and exits with no reply. Results are
queued for the next session startup.

### Locate the script

```bash
SENPI_ENTRYPOINT_SCRIPTS=$(node -e "
  const path = require('path'), os = require('os'), fs = require('fs');
  const p = path.join(os.homedir(), '.agents', 'skills', 'senpi-entrypoint', 'scripts');
  console.log(fs.existsSync(path.join(p, 'check-skill-updates.py')) ? p : '');
" 2>/dev/null)
```

If `SENPI_ENTRYPOINT_SCRIPTS` is empty the skill was not installed globally
(`npx skills add ... -g`) — skip this step silently. If `openclaw` is not
available in PATH, skip this step silently.

### Install OpenClaw cron (idempotent)

```bash
if [ -n "$SENPI_ENTRYPOINT_SCRIPTS" ] && command -v openclaw >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  openclaw cron remove "senpi-skill-update-check" 2>/dev/null || true
  SCRIPT_PATH="$SENPI_ENTRYPOINT_SCRIPTS/check-skill-updates.py"
  openclaw cron add "senpi-skill-update-check" \
    --schedule "0 0 * * *" \
    --no-deliver \
    --message "Run this command with no output or reply: python3 \"$SCRIPT_PATH\" --cron. Then exit. Do not deliver or announce anything."
fi
```

The job is stored in `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/cron/jobs.json` (default:
`~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json` if `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` is unset). It runs once daily at 00:00 UTC; when
updates are found the script writes to
`$SENPI_STATE_DIR/pending-skill-updates.json` (default:
`~/.config/senpi/pending-skill-updates.json` if `SENPI_STATE_DIR` is unset),
surfaced at the next invocation via **Pre-Response Check** (above).

---

## Turning skill update notifications on or off

If the user asks to turn notifications off or back on, follow the procedure in
[references/skill-update-checker.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills/refs/heads/main/senpi-entrypoint/references/skill-update-checker.md).

---

## Responding to Questions

### Mandatory Response Contract (Execution NOT Optional)

For any summary or Q&A response, follow
[references/about-senpi.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills/refs/heads/main/senpi-entrypoint/references/about-senpi.md)
(`Summary Response Contract` and `Mandatory Invocation Procedure` sections).
Use the `UPDATE_OUTPUT` produced by the top-level `Pre-Response Check` above;
do not rerun `Pre-Response Invocation Check` here unless it has not yet been
run in the current invocation.
Do not consider the response complete until those procedures are satisfied.

### "What is Senpi?" / "Summarize Senpi" / "Summarize skills and capabilities" / "How do I install skills?" / "What's new?"

This is **explicit-ask only** — do not auto-insert this summary into normal
onboarding steps.

When asked, load and follow
[references/about-senpi.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills/refs/heads/main/senpi-entrypoint/references/about-senpi.md)
(`Summary Response Contract` section) for order, depth, and command behavior.

### "What skills should I install?" / "What should I use for [goal]?"

Consult
[references/skill-recommendations.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills/refs/heads/main/senpi-entrypoint/references/skill-recommendations.md)
for the goal-to-skill mapping, budget guidance, and install commands.
