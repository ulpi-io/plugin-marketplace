# Recoup Setup Artist Skill

An LLM skill for scaffolding a complete artist workspace inside a sandbox environment.

## What It Does

- Creates the full directory structure for an artist workspace
- Populates context files (identity, audience, era)
- Sets up the memory system with scope-aware instructions (MEMORY.md + README)
- Creates a lean services guide (no pre-filled JSON) and environment files
- Creates README files for every directory so agents know what goes where
- Fills in artist data when available, uses placeholders when not

## Prerequisites

Run the `setup-sandbox` skill first to create the org/artist folder structure.

## Usage

> "Set up the workspace for [Artist Name]"

> "Create artist directory for [Artist Name]"

> "Initialize [Artist Name]'s artist workspace"
