## Skill Structure (Required)

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: instructions + metadata (must be human-readable too)
├── metadata.json     # Optional: extended metadata for publishing
├── references/       # Optional: documentation, guides, API references
├── examples/         # Optional: sample outputs, usage examples
├── scripts/          # Optional: executable code
└── assets/           # Optional: templates, images, data files
```

_Note on README.md: Anthropic's official guide strictly prohibits including a `README.md` inside the skill folder to avoid confusing the agent. `SKILL.md` is the single source of truth and must be written to be equally readable by humans and agents. If you are migrating an existing skill that has a `README.md`, merge its useful information (like links and brief description) into `SKILL.md` and delete the `README.md`._

### Folder Purposes (CRITICAL)

| Folder        | Purpose                                    | Examples                                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `references/` | **Documentation** for agents to read       | Guides, API docs, concept explanations, troubleshooting |
| `examples/`   | **Sample outputs** showing expected format | Output examples, usage demonstrations                   |
| `assets/`     | **Static resources** to copy/use           | Document templates, config templates, images, schemas   |
| `scripts/`    | **Executable code** to run                 | Python scripts, shell scripts, validators               |

### When to Use Each

**Use `references/` for:**

- Detailed documentation about concepts
- API references and usage guides
- Troubleshooting and FAQ
- Anything the agent needs to **read and understand**

**Use `examples/` for:**

- Sample outputs showing expected format
- Usage demonstrations
- Before/after comparisons
- Anything showing **what the result should look like**

**Use `assets/` for:**

- Document templates (markdown files to copy as starting point)
- Configuration file templates
- Schema files, lookup tables
- Images and diagrams
- Anything the agent needs to **copy or reference verbatim**

**IMPORTANT**: Templates belong in `assets/`, examples in `examples/`, documentation in `references/`.

## Frontmatter Schema

Every `SKILL.md` MUST start with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: "What it does. Keywords: term1, term2."
version: "1.2.3"
release_date: "2026-01-01"
metadata:
  author: your-name
---
```

**Field order:** `name` → `description` → `version` → `release_date` → `license` → `compatibility` → `metadata`

### Required Fields

| Field       | Constraints                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name        | 1-64 chars, lowercase `a-z0-9-`, no `--`, no leading/trailing `-`, must match folder name   |
| description | 1-1024 chars (target: 80-150), describes what skill does + when to use it, include keywords |

### Optional Fields (Top Level)

| Field         | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| version       | Upstream product version; `"—"` if product has no versioning |
| release_date  | Date skill was last meaningfully updated (`YYYY-MM-DD`)      |
| license       | License name or reference to bundled LICENSE file            |
| compatibility | Environment requirements (max 500 chars)                     |
| metadata      | Object for arbitrary key-value pairs (see below)             |

### metadata Object (Common Fields)

| Field         | Purpose                                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| author        | Author name or organization                   |
| argument-hint | Hint for autocomplete, e.g., `[issue-number]` |

### Optional Fields (Claude Code / Advanced)

| Field                    | Purpose                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| disable-model-invocation | `true` = only user can invoke (via `/name`). Default: `false`              |
| user-invocable           | `false` = hidden from `/` menu, only agent can load. Default: `true`       |
| allowed-tools            | Space-delimited tools agent can use without asking, e.g., `Read Grep Glob` |
| model                    | Specific model to use when skill is active                                 |
| context                  | Set to `fork` to run in a forked subagent context                          |
| agent                    | Subagent type when `context: fork`, e.g., `Explore`, `Plan`                |
| hooks                    | Hooks scoped to skill's lifecycle (see agent documentation)                |

### Invocation Control Matrix

| Frontmatter                      | User can invoke | Agent can invoke | Notes                                   |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| (default)                        | ✅ Yes          | ✅ Yes           | Description in context, loads when used |
| `disable-model-invocation: true` | ✅ Yes          | ❌ No            | For manual workflows with side effects  |
| `user-invocable: false`          | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes           | Background knowledge, not a command     |

### Variable Substitutions

Available placeholders in skill content:

| Variable               | Description                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$ARGUMENTS`           | All arguments passed when invoking the skill             |
| `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` | Current session ID for logging or session-specific files |

If `$ARGUMENTS` is not in content, arguments are appended as `ARGUMENTS: <value>`.

Example:

```yaml
---
name: fix-issue
description: Fix a GitHub issue
disable-model-invocation: true
---
Fix GitHub issue $ARGUMENTS following our coding standards.
```

### Dynamic Context Injection

Use `!`command`` syntax to run shell commands before skill content is sent to the agent:

```markdown
## Pull request context

- PR diff: !`gh pr diff`
- Changed files: !`gh pr diff --name-only`

## Your task

Review this pull request...
```

The command output replaces the placeholder, so the agent receives actual data.

## metadata.json (Optional)

For publishing or extended metadata, create `metadata.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "organization": "Your Org",
  "date": "January 2026",
  "abstract": "Brief description of what this skill provides...",
  "references": ["https://docs.example.com", "https://github.com/org/repo"]
}
```

**Fields:**

- `version` — Skill version (semver)
- `organization` — Author or organization
- `date` — Publication date
- `abstract` — Extended description (can be longer than frontmatter)
- `references` — List of source documentation URLs

### Name Validation Examples

```yaml
# Valid
name: pdf-processing
name: data-analysis
name: code-review

# Invalid
name: PDF-Processing  # uppercase not allowed
name: -pdf            # cannot start with hyphen
name: pdf--processing # consecutive hyphens not allowed
```

### Description Rules

**Purpose:** Tell the LLM what the skill does and when to activate it. Minimize tokens — just enough for activation decision.

**Formulas:**

For library/reference skills (Claude Code, keyword-based discovery):

```
[Product] [core function]. Covers [2-3 key topics]. Keywords: [terms].
```

For workflow/automation skills (Claude.ai, trigger-based activation):

```
[What it does]. Use when user [specific trigger phrases].
```

**Critical for auto-triggering:** include explicit "Use when user says / asks / mentions..." phrases. Without them, Claude may not load the skill automatically. See `references/writing-skills.md` for good/bad examples and debugging tips.

**Constraints:**

- Target: 80-150 chars
- Max: 1024 chars (300 if keeping it minimal)
- No marketing ("powerful", "comprehensive", "modern")
- No filler ("this skill", "use this for", "helps with")
- No XML angle brackets `< >`
- Names with "claude" or "anthropic" are reserved

**Good examples:**

```yaml
description: "Turso SQLite database. Covers encryption, sync, agent patterns. Keywords: Turso, libSQL, SQLite."

description: "Base UI unstyled React components. Covers forms, menus, overlays. Keywords: @base-ui/react, render props."

description: "Inworld TTS API. Covers voice cloning, audio markups, timestamps. Keywords: Inworld, TTS, visemes."
```

**Poor examples:**

```yaml
# Too vague
description: "Helps with PDFs."

# Too verbose
description: "Turso embedded SQLite database for modern apps and AI agents. Covers encryption, authorization, sync, partial sync, and agent database patterns."

# Marketing
description: "A powerful solution for all your database needs."
```

**Keywords:** product name, package name, 3-5 terms max.

## How Skills Work (Progressive Disclosure)

1. **Discovery**: Agent loads only `name` + `description` of each skill (~50-100 tokens)
2. **Activation**: When task matches, agent reads full `SKILL.md` into context
3. **Execution**: Agent follows instructions, loads referenced files as needed

**Key rule:** Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Move details to `references/`.

## Creating a New Skill

_Pro Tip: You can use the `skill-creator` skill (available in Claude.ai or Claude Code) to interactively generate your first draft, then refine it using the steps below._

### Step 1: Scaffold

```bash
python scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name>
# Or specify custom directory:
python scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --skills-dir skills
```

Or manually create:

```
<skills-folder>/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md
├── references/   # For documentation, guides
└── assets/       # For templates, static files
```

### Step 2: Write Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: <skill-name>
description: "[Purpose] + [Triggers/Keywords]"
---
```

### Step 3: Write Body

Recommended sections:

- When to use (triggers, situations)
- Quick navigation (router to references and assets)
- Steps / Recipes / Checklists
- Critical prohibitions
- Links

### Step 4: Add References (documentation)

For each major topic, create `references/<topic>.md` with:

- Actionable takeaways (5-15 bullets)
- Gotchas / prohibitions
- Practical examples

### Step 5: Add Scripts (if applicable)

Consult `references/scripts.md` for when scripts are worth writing and how to structure them.

Language selection:

- **Python** — default for CLI wrappers, validators, scaffolding
- **Go** — when the skill's ecosystem is Kubernetes/cloud-native (see k8s-cluster-api)
- **JS/TS** — when the skill's ecosystem is Node/npm

Minimal checklist for a script:

- `argparse` (Python) or `flag` (Go) for all parameters — no hardcoded values
- Check tool availability before use (`shutil.which()` in Python)
- Docstring at top with Usage + Examples
- All exceptions caught; exit non-zero with a message to stderr

### Step 6: Add Assets (if needed)

Consult `references/assets.md` for when assets are worth creating and how to format them.

For templates or static resources, create `assets/<resource>`. Common types:

- **Config templates** — `.minimal.yaml` / `.full.yaml` pair; add `# yaml-language-server: $schema=` header
- **YAML manifests** — use `${VAR_NAME:=default}` for variables; include purpose + usage comment at top
- **Text templates** — use `#`-prefixed comments to explain fields and valid values
- **Markdown checklists / runbooks** — `- [ ]` checkboxes, inline commands, sign-off section
- **Prompt / prose templates** — grouped by use case, each block self-contained

Naming: `<tool>.minimal.yaml`, `<purpose>-checklist.md`, `<name>.template`, `<topic>-prompts.md`.

### Step 7: Validate

```bash
python scripts/quick_validate_skill.py <skill-path>
```

## Creating a Skill from Documentation

When building a skill from external docs, use the autonomous ingestion workflow:

### Phase 1: Scaffold

1. Create skill folder with `SKILL.md` skeleton
2. Create `plan.md` for progress tracking
3. Create `references/` directory

### Phase 2: Build Queue

For each doc link:

- Fetch the page
- Extract internal doc links (avoid nav duplicates)
- Prioritize: concepts → API → operations → troubleshooting

### Phase 3: Ingest Loop

For each page:

1. Fetch **one** page
2. Create `references/<topic>.md` with actionable summary
3. Update `plan.md` checkbox
4. Update `SKILL.md` if it adds a useful recipe/rule

**Do not ask user after each page** — continue autonomously.

### Phase 4: Finalize

- Review `SKILL.md` for completeness
- Ensure practical recipes, not docs mirror
- `plan.md` may be deleted manually after ingestion

## Critical Prohibitions

- Do NOT copy large verbatim chunks from vendor docs (summarize in own words)
- Do NOT write skills in languages other than English
- Do NOT include project-specific secrets, paths, or assumptions
- Do NOT keep `SKILL.md` over 500 lines
- Do NOT skip `name` validation (must match folder name)
- Do NOT use poor descriptions that lack trigger keywords
- Do NOT omit product version when creating skills from documentation

## Version Tracking

### What `version` Means

`version` holds the **upstream product version** the skill was built against (e.g., `"1.12.3"` for CAPI v1.12.3). For standalone skills not tied to an external product, it holds the **skill's own version** (e.g., `"1.2.4"` for skill-master).

Use `"—"` when the product uses continuous deployment with no semantic versioning (e.g., hosted services like Cloudflare Workers).

### When to Update

| Trigger                              | Update `version` | Update `release_date` |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Product released a new version       | ✅ Yes           | ✅ Yes                |
| Content changed, no upstream version | ❌ No            | ✅ Yes                |
| Typo or minor fix                    | ❌ No            | ❌ No                 |

When bumping `version` or making significant content changes, also update:

- `SKILLS_VERSIONS.md` — set new version + date, move row to top of table
- `CHANGELOG.md` — prepend a new dated block at the top

### Creating a Skill from Docs

1. Set `version` to the exact upstream version you documented (check the release page)
2. Set `release_date` to today's date
3. Ensure `SKILL.md` has an overview (1-2 sentences) + `## Links` section

**Links format:**

```markdown
## Links

- [Documentation](https://example.com/docs)
- [Changelog](https://example.com/changelog)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/org/repo)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/name)
```

Order: Documentation → Changelog/Releases → GitHub → Package registry. Include only applicable links.

## Validation Checklist
