# Architecture Review

Analyze, audit, and improve project structure.

## Key Principles

- **Measure before changing** — Map structure and identify concrete issues before proposing changes
- **Clear boundaries** — Layers (UI, logic, data) separated with consistent dependency direction
- **Colocation** — Related code together; easy to find, change, and delete features
- **Incremental migration** — Refactor in phases, validate each step with tests

## Quick Assessment

- No circular dependencies
- Consistent directory naming and grouping (by feature or by type)
- Single responsibility per file/module, reasonable file sizes (<500 lines)
- External dependencies isolated, shared code properly extracted
- New developers can navigate and find code for any feature easily

## Quick Start Checklist

1. Map current structure: directory tree, dependency graph, module boundaries
2. Identify issues: circular deps, god modules, leaky abstractions, deep nesting
3. Classify severity: critical (blocks dev), high (maintenance burden), medium/low (friction)
4. Propose target structure with migration plan
5. Execute incrementally, validating with tests after each move
