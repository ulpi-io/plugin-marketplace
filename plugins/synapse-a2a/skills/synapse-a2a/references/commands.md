# CLI Command Reference

## Agent Management

### List Running Agents

```bash
# Show all running agents (Rich TUI with auto-refresh on changes)
synapse list
```

**Rich TUI Features:**
- Auto-refresh when agent status changes (via file watcher)
- Color-coded status display:
  - READY = green (idle, waiting for input)
  - WAITING = cyan (awaiting user input - selection, confirmation; auto-expires after `waiting_expiry`, default 10s)
  - PROCESSING = yellow (busy handling a task)
  - DONE = blue (task completed, auto-clears after 10s)
  - SHUTTING_DOWN = red (graceful shutdown in progress)
- **Compound signal detection**: Status uses multiple signals beyond PTY output:
  - `task_active` flag: suppresses READY during active A2A tasks (`task_protection_timeout`, default 30s)
  - File locks: agents holding locks remain PROCESSING even when PTY is idle
  - WAITING auto-expiry: auto-clears after `waiting_expiry` seconds (default 10s)
- Flicker-free updates
- **Interactive row selection**: Press 1-9 or ↑/↓ to select an agent row and view full paths in a detail panel
- **Terminal Jump**: Press `Enter` or `j` to jump directly to the selected agent's terminal
- **Kill Agent**: Press `k` to terminate selected agent (with confirmation dialog)
- **Filter**: Press `/` to filter by TYPE, NAME, or WORKING_DIR
- Press `ESC` to clear filter/selection, `q` to exit

**Terminal Jump Supported Terminals:**
- iTerm2 (macOS) - Switches to correct tab/pane
- Terminal.app (macOS) - Switches to correct tab
- Ghostty (macOS) - Activates application. **Note:** Ghostty uses AppleScript to target the focused tab. Do not switch tabs during spawn or team start.
- VS Code integrated terminal - Activates/focuses VS Code window
- tmux - Switches to agent's session/pane
- Zellij - Activates terminal app (direct pane focus not supported via CLI)

**Output columns:**
- **NAME**: Custom name if set, otherwise agent type (e.g., `my-claude` or `claude`)
- **TYPE**: Agent type (claude, gemini, codex, opencode, copilot)
- **ID**: Full Runtime ID (e.g., `synapse-claude-8100`)
- **ROLE**: Role description if set
- **STATUS**: READY / WAITING / PROCESSING / DONE / SHUTTING_DOWN
- **CURRENT**: Current task preview (truncated to 30 chars) with elapsed time (e.g., `Review code (2m 15s)`) - shows what agent is working on and for how long
- **TRANSPORT**: Communication method during inter-agent messages
  - `UDS→` / `TCP→`: Sending via UDS/TCP
  - `→UDS` / `→TCP`: Receiving via UDS/TCP
  - `-`: No active communication
- **WORKING_DIR**: Working directory (truncated in TUI, full path in detail panel). Also included in non-TTY text output for scripting (e.g., `synapse list | grep my-project`).
- **EDITING FILE** (when File Safety enabled): Currently locked file name

**Name vs ID:** Display shows name if set, internal operations use Runtime ID (`synapse-claude-8100`).

```

### Spawn Single Agent

Spawn a single agent in a new terminal pane or window. Accepts profile names or saved agent IDs/names.

**Workflow:** Spawn is sub-agent delegation — the parent spawns children to offload subtasks while preserving its own context. The full lifecycle is: spawn → send task → evaluate result → (re-send if needed) → kill. If the user specifies the number of agents, follow that exactly; otherwise the parent decides based on task structure. See `references/examples.md` → "Sub-Agent Delegation Patterns" for concrete patterns.

```bash
synapse spawn claude                          # Spawn Claude in a new pane
synapse spawn gemini --port 8115              # Spawn with explicit port
synapse spawn claude --name Tester --role "test writer"  # With name/role
synapse spawn claude --skill-set dev-set      # With skill set
synapse spawn claude --terminal tmux          # Use specific terminal
synapse spawn claude -n Tester -r "reviewer" -S backend-tools  # Short options

# Spawn from saved agent definition (by ID or display name)
synapse spawn sharp-checker                    # Spawn by saved Agent ID
synapse spawn Claud                           # Spawn by saved agent display name
synapse spawn sharp-checker --role "temporary override"  # Override saved values

# Worktree isolation (Synapse-level flag, before '--'; works for ALL agent types)
synapse spawn claude --name Impl --role "implementer" --worktree            # auto-named worktree
synapse spawn gemini --name Analyst -w feat-auth                            # named worktree
synapse spawn codex --name Coder --worktree                                 # Codex in worktree

# Pass tool-specific arguments after '--' (permission skip flags per CLI)
synapse spawn claude -- --dangerously-skip-permissions   # Claude: skip all prompts
synapse spawn gemini -- -y                               # Gemini: yolo mode
synapse spawn codex -- --full-auto                       # Codex: sandboxed auto-approve
synapse spawn copilot -- --allow-all-tools               # Copilot: allow all tools

# Combine worktree + tool args (worktree before '--', tool args after '--')
synapse spawn claude --name Impl --worktree -- --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**Worktree Isolation (`--worktree` / `-w`, Synapse-native flag):**
`--worktree` is a Synapse-level flag placed **before** `--`. It creates an isolated git worktree for any agent type under `.synapse/worktrees/<name>/` with a branch named `worktree-<name>`. Each worktree gets its own branch and working directory, preventing file conflicts when multiple agents edit the same codebase. `synapse list` shows a `[WT]` prefix in the WORKING_DIR column for worktree agents. Environment variables `SYNAPSE_WORKTREE_PATH`, `SYNAPSE_WORKTREE_BRANCH`, and `SYNAPSE_WORKTREE_BASE_BRANCH` are set automatically. The base branch is determined via a 3-step fallback: `git symbolic-ref` -> `origin/main` -> `HEAD`. Note: `.gitignore`-listed files (`.env`, `.venv/`, `node_modules/`) are not copied -- run dependency install or copy `.env` if needed. On exit, cleanup checks for both uncommitted changes and new commits (vs. the base branch); worktrees with neither are auto-deleted, worktrees with either prompt to keep or remove. The registry stores `worktree_base_branch` so cleanup can detect new commits accurately. `synapse kill` also handles worktree cleanup. Consider adding `.synapse/worktrees/` to your `.gitignore` to avoid untracked worktree files appearing in `git status`.

**Headless Mode:**
When an agent is started via `synapse spawn` or `synapse team start`, `--no-setup --headless` are always added. This skips all interactive setup (name/role prompts, startup animations, and initial instruction approval prompts) to allow for smooth programmatic orchestration. The A2A server remains active, and initial instructions are still sent to enable communication.

**Readiness Warning:** After spawning, `synapse spawn` waits for the agent to register and warns with concrete `synapse send` command examples if the agent is not yet ready. Additionally, a server-side Readiness Gate blocks `/tasks/send` until initialization completes (HTTP 503 + `Retry-After: 5` if not ready within 30s; priority 5 and replies bypass).

**Tool Args Guardrail:** Synapse flags (`--port`, `--name`, `--role`, etc.) placed after `--` are detected and trigger a warning, since they should go before `--`.

**Note:** The spawning agent is responsible for the lifecycle of the spawned agent. Ensure you terminate spawned agents using `synapse kill <target> -f` when their task is complete.

**Spawn Zone Tiling (tmux):** `synapse spawn` uses `layout="auto"` by default. In tmux, spawned pane IDs are tracked via `SYNAPSE_SPAWN_PANES` in the tmux session environment. The first spawn splits the current pane horizontally; subsequent spawns find the largest pane in the spawn zone and split it, producing balanced tiled layouts automatically. See `references/spawning.md` for details.

**Pane Auto-Close:** Spawned panes close automatically when the agent process terminates in all supported terminals (tmux, zellij, iTerm2, Terminal.app, Ghostty).

**Known Limitation:** Spawned agents cannot use `synapse reply` because PTY-injected messages don't register sender info. Use `synapse send <target> "message"` instead (`--from` is auto-detected) ([#237](https://github.com/s-hiraoku/synapse-a2a/issues/237)).

### Stop Agents

```bash
# Stop by profile
synapse stop claude

# Stop by specific ID (recommended for precision)
synapse stop synapse-claude-8100

# Stop all instances of a profile
synapse stop claude --all
```

### Kill Agents

```bash
# Graceful shutdown (default): multi-phase — SHUTTING_DOWN → HTTP request → grace → SIGTERM → SIGKILL
synapse kill my-claude

# Kill by Runtime ID
synapse kill synapse-claude-8100

# Kill by agent type (only if single instance)
synapse kill claude

# Force kill (immediate SIGKILL, skip graceful shutdown)
synapse kill my-claude -f
```

**Graceful shutdown flow** (total budget: `shutdown.timeout_seconds`, default 30s):
1. Sets agent status to `SHUTTING_DOWN`
2. Sends `shutdown_request` A2A message (HTTP, up to `min(10s, total budget)`)
3. Waits grace period (`min(max(1, remaining // 3), remaining)` — targets 1/3 of remaining budget, capped to `remaining`; **0s when budget ≤ 10s**), then sends SIGTERM
4. Waits escalation period (budget remaining after step 3), then sends SIGKILL if process is still alive
5. With `-f`: sends SIGKILL immediately, skipping all phases

### Jump to Terminal

```bash
# Jump by custom name
synapse jump my-claude

# Jump by Runtime ID
synapse jump synapse-claude-8100

# Jump by agent type (only if single instance)
synapse jump claude
```

**Supported Terminals:** iTerm2, Terminal.app, Ghostty, VS Code, tmux, Zellij

### Rename Agents

Assign or update custom names and roles for running agents:

```bash
# Set name and role
synapse rename synapse-claude-8100 --name my-claude --role "code reviewer"

# Update role only (use current name)
synapse rename my-claude --role "test writer"

# Clear name and role
synapse rename my-claude --clear
```

**Name vs ID:**
- Custom names are for **display and user-facing operations** (prompts, `synapse list` output)
- Runtime ID (`synapse-claude-8100`) is used **internally** for registry and processing
- Target resolution: name has highest priority when matching

### Show Agent Status

Show detailed status for a single agent, including agent info, current task with elapsed time, recent messages, file locks, and task board assignments.

```bash
# Human-readable output
synapse status my-claude
synapse status synapse-claude-8100
synapse status claude              # Only if single instance

# Machine-readable JSON
synapse status my-claude --json
```

**Text output sections:**
- **Agent Info**: ID, type, name, role, port, status, PID, working directory, uptime
- **Current Task**: Task preview with elapsed time (e.g., `Review code (2m 15s)`)
- **Recent Messages**: Last 5 messages from history (task ID, direction, sender, preview)
- **File Locks**: Files currently locked by this agent (if File Safety is enabled)
- **Task Board**: Tasks assigned to this agent (if Task Board is active)

**JSON output** includes all the same data in structured format, with `uptime_seconds` and `current_task.elapsed_seconds` as numeric values for programmatic use.

**Use cases:**
- Checking what an agent is currently working on and how long it has been running
- Debugging why an agent is stuck in PROCESSING (check file locks, task board)
- Reviewing recent communication history for a specific agent

### Saved Agent Definitions

Manage reusable agent definitions that persist across sessions. Saved agents are stored as `.agent` files in project (`.synapse/agents/`) or user (`~/.synapse/agents/`) scope.

IDs must use Agent ID format (e.g., `sharp-checker`).

```bash
# List all saved agent definitions
synapse agents list

# Show details for a saved agent (by ID or display name)
synapse agents show <id-or-name>

# Add or update a saved agent definition
synapse agents add <id> --name <name> --profile <profile> [--role <role>] [--skill-set <set>] [--scope project|user]

# Delete a saved agent definition
synapse agents delete <id-or-name>
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Save a codex agent with role from file
synapse agents add sharp-checker --name Reviewer --profile codex --role @./roles/reviewer.md --skill-set architect --scope project

# List saved agents (Rich TUI table when interactive)
synapse agents list

# Show saved agent details
synapse agents show sharp-checker
synapse agents show Reviewer          # Also resolves by display name

# Delete a saved agent
synapse agents delete sharp-checker
```

**Output columns** (in `synapse agents list`):
- **ID**: Agent ID identifier (e.g., `sharp-checker`)
- **NAME**: Display name
- **PROFILE**: Agent type (claude, codex, gemini, opencode, copilot)
- **ROLE**: Role description (or `-` if not set)
- **SKILL_SET**: Skill set name (or `-` if not set)
- **SCOPE**: Storage scope (`project` or `user`)

**Resolution order:** When resolving `<id-or-name>`, exact ID match is checked first, then display name match. An error is raised if the query matches multiple entries.

**Storage:**
- Project scope: `.synapse/agents/<id>.agent`
- User scope: `~/.synapse/agents/<id>.agent`
- Project-scoped definitions take precedence over user-scoped when IDs collide.

### Port Ranges

| Agent    | Ports     |
|----------|-----------|
| Claude   | 8100-8109 |
| Gemini   | 8110-8119 |
| Codex    | 8120-8129 |
| OpenCode | 8130-8139 |
| Copilot  | 8140-8149 |

## Receiving Messages

When you receive an A2A message, it appears with the `A2A:` prefix that includes optional sender identification and reply expectations:

**Message Formats:**
```
A2A: [From: NAME (SENDER_ID)] [REPLY EXPECTED] <message content>
```

- **From**: Identifies the sender's display name and Runtime ID.
- **REPLY EXPECTED**: Indicates that the sender is waiting for a response (blocking).

If sender information is not available, it falls back to:
- `A2A: [From: SENDER_ID] <message content>`
- `A2A: <message content>` (backward compatible format)

If `[REPLY EXPECTED]` marker is present, you **MUST** reply using `synapse reply`.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT manually include `[REPLY EXPECTED]` in your messages. Synapse adds this marker automatically when `--wait` is used. Manually adding it causes duplication.

**Reply Tracking:** Synapse automatically tracks senders who expect a reply (`[REPLY EXPECTED]` messages). Use `synapse reply` for responses - it automatically knows who to reply to.

**Replying to messages:**

```bash
# Use the reply command (auto-routes to last sender)
synapse reply "<your reply>"

# In sandboxed environments (like Codex), specify your Runtime ID
synapse reply "<your reply>" --from $SYNAPSE_AGENT_ID
```

**Example - Question received (MUST reply):**
```
Received: A2A: [From: Claude (synapse-claude-8100)] [REPLY EXPECTED] What is the project structure?
Reply:    synapse reply "The project has src/, tests/..."
```

**Example - Delegation received (no reply needed):**
```
Received: A2A: [From: Gemini (synapse-gemini-8110)] Run the tests and fix failures
Action:   Just do the task. No reply needed unless you have questions.
```

## Sending Messages

### synapse send (Recommended)

**Use this command for inter-agent communication.** Works from any environment including sandboxed agents.

```bash
synapse send <target> "<message>" [--from <sender>] [--priority <1-5>] [--wait | --notify | --silent] [--callback "<command>"] [--force]
```

**Target Formats (in priority order):**

| Format | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Custom name | `my-claude` | Highest priority, exact match, case-sensitive |
| Full ID | `synapse-claude-8100` | Always works, unique identifier |
| Type-port | `claude-8100` | Use when multiple agents of same type |
| Agent type | `claude` | Only when single instance exists |

**Parameters:**
- `--from, -f`: Sender Runtime ID (for reply identification) - **auto-detected** from `SYNAPSE_AGENT_ID` env var. Usually omittable; specify explicitly in sandboxed environments (e.g., Codex). When using, always provide the Runtime ID format (`synapse-<type>-<port>`). Note: `-f` means `--force` in other subcommands (e.g., `synapse kill -f`); prefer the long form `--from` to avoid confusion.
- `--priority, -p`: Priority level 1-5 (default: 3)
  - 1-2: Low priority, background tasks
  - 3: Normal tasks
  - 4: Urgent follow-ups
  - 5: Critical/emergency (sends SIGINT first)
- `--wait`: Synchronous blocking - wait for receiver to reply with `synapse reply`
- `--notify`: Async notification - get notified when task completes (default)
- `--silent`: Fire and forget - no reply or PTY notification needed. The receiver sends a best-effort completion callback (`POST /history/update`) to update the sender's history when the task finishes.
- `--callback`: Shell command to run on sender after task completion (requires `--silent`)
- `--message-file`: Read message from file (use `-` for stdin)
- `--stdin`: Read message from stdin
- `--attach`: Attach file(s) to message (repeatable)
- `--force`: Bypass the working directory mismatch check (send to agents in different directories)

**Working Directory Check:** Before sending, `synapse send` verifies that your current working directory matches the target agent's working directory. If they differ, the command prints a warning (listing agents in your current directory or suggesting `synapse spawn`) and exits with code 1. Use `--force` to skip this check.

**Choosing response mode:**

Analyze the message content and determine if you need immediate results:
- If you need immediate results and want to block until reply → use `--wait`
- If you want to be notified when the task is done (async) → use `--notify` (default)
- If the message is purely informational with no notification needed → use `--silent`

| Message Type | Mode | Example |
|--------------|------|---------|
| Question | `--wait` | "What is the status?" |
| Request for analysis | `--wait` | "Please review this code" |
| Status check | `--wait` | "Are you ready?" |
| Task with result expected | `--notify` | "Run tests and report the results" |
| Delegated task (fire-and-forget) | `--silent` | "Fix this bug and commit" |
| Notification | `--silent` | "FYI: Build completed" |

**Completion Callback:** With `--silent`, the receiver sends a best-effort callback to the sender when the task completes or fails. This updates the sender's history from `sent` to the final status with an output summary. The callback is fire-and-forget; failures are logged but do not block the receiver.

**Examples:**
```bash
# Question - immediate reply needed (blocking)
synapse send gemini "What is the best approach?" --wait

# Task with result expected (async notification - default)
synapse send codex "Run pytest and report the results" --notify

# Delegation with no result needed - fire and forget
synapse send codex "Fix this bug and commit" --silent

# Send to specific instance with status check
synapse send claude-8100 "What is your status?" --wait

# Emergency interrupt
synapse send codex "STOP" --priority 5

# Send to agent in a different working directory (bypasses working_dir check)
synapse send my-claude "Cross-project info" --force
```

**Sending long messages or files:**
```bash
# Send message from file (avoids ARG_MAX shell limits)
synapse send claude --message-file /tmp/review.txt --silent

# Read message from stdin
echo "long message" | synapse send claude --stdin --silent
synapse send claude --message-file - --silent   # '-' reads from stdin

# Attach files to message
synapse send claude "Review this" --attach src/main.py --silent
synapse send claude "Review these" --attach src/a.py --attach src/b.py --silent
```

Messages >100KB are automatically written to temp files (configurable via `SYNAPSE_SEND_MESSAGE_THRESHOLD`).

**Important:** `--from` is auto-detected from `$SYNAPSE_AGENT_ID` (set at startup, expands to `synapse-<type>-<port>`). You can usually omit it. If you specify it explicitly, never hardcode Runtime IDs -- always use `$SYNAPSE_AGENT_ID`.

### Interrupt Command

Shorthand for sending a priority-4, fire-and-forget message:

```bash
synapse interrupt <target> "<message>" [--from <sender>] [--force]
```

Equivalent to `synapse send <target> "<message>" -p 4 --silent [--from <sender>]`.

**Parameters:**
- `target`: Target agent (name, ID, type-port, or agent type)
- `message`: Interrupt message to send
- `--from, -f`: Sender Runtime ID (auto-detected from `SYNAPSE_AGENT_ID` env var)
- `--force`: Bypass the working directory mismatch check

**Examples:**
```bash
# Interrupt an agent with an urgent message
synapse interrupt claude "Stop and review"

# With explicit sender (usually not needed)
synapse interrupt gemini "Check status" --from $SYNAPSE_AGENT_ID

# Interrupt agent in a different working directory
synapse interrupt claude "Stop" --force
```

### Reply Command

Reply to the last received message:

```bash
synapse reply "<message>"
```

Synapse automatically knows who to reply to based on tracked senders. The `--from` flag is only needed in sandboxed environments (like Codex).

If multiple senders are pending, list and choose explicitly:

```bash
# Show tracked sender IDs
synapse reply --list-targets

# Reply to a specific sender
synapse reply "<message>" --to <sender_id>
```

### Broadcast Command

Send a message to all agents in the current working directory:

```bash
synapse broadcast "<message>" [--from <sender>] [--priority <1-5>] [--wait | --notify | --silent]
```

**Parameters:**
- `message`: Message to broadcast to all cwd agents
- `--from, -f`: Sender Runtime ID (auto-detected from `SYNAPSE_AGENT_ID` env var)
- `--priority, -p`: Priority level 1-5 (default: 1)
- `--wait`: Synchronous wait for all agents
- `--notify`: Async notification from each agent (default)
- `--silent`: Fire-and-forget broadcast

**Scope:** Only targets agents sharing the same working directory as the sender.

**Examples:**
```bash
# Broadcast status check
synapse broadcast "Status check"

# Urgent broadcast with priority
synapse broadcast "Stop current work" --priority 4

# Fire-and-forget notification
synapse broadcast "FYI: Build completed" --silent

# Wait for responses from all agents
synapse broadcast "What are you working on?" --wait
```

### A2A Tool (Advanced)

For advanced use cases or external scripts:

```bash
python -m synapse.tools.a2a send --target <AGENT> [--priority <1-5>] "<MESSAGE>"
python -m synapse.tools.a2a broadcast [--priority <1-5>] [--from <AGENT>] [--wait | --silent] "<MESSAGE>"  # Broadcast to cwd agents
python -m synapse.tools.a2a reply "<MESSAGE>"  # Reply to last received message
python -m synapse.tools.a2a reply --list-targets
python -m synapse.tools.a2a reply "<MESSAGE>" --to <SENDER_ID>
python -m synapse.tools.a2a list                # List agents
python -m synapse.tools.a2a cleanup             # Cleanup stale entries
```

## Task History

Enabled by default (v0.3.13+). To disable: `SYNAPSE_HISTORY_ENABLED=false`.

### List History

```bash
# Recent tasks (default: 50)
synapse history list

# Filter by agent
synapse history list --agent claude

# Limit results
synapse history list --limit 100
```

### Show Task Details

```bash
synapse history show <task_id>
```

### Search Tasks

```bash
# Search by keywords (OR logic)
synapse history search "Python" "Docker" --logic OR

# Search with AND logic
synapse history search "error" "authentication" --logic AND

# Filter by agent
synapse history search "bug" --agent claude --limit 20
```

### View Statistics

```bash
# Overall statistics
synapse history stats

# Per-agent statistics
synapse history stats --agent gemini
```

When token data exists in observation metadata, the output includes a TOKEN USAGE section showing input/output token counts and estimated cost (per-agent breakdown when available). Token data is populated by agent-specific parsers in `synapse/token_parser.py` (skeleton -- no parsers shipped yet).

### Export Data

```bash
# Export to JSON
synapse history export --format json > history.json

# Export to CSV
synapse history export --format csv --agent claude > claude_tasks.csv

# Export to file
synapse history export --format json --output export.json
```

### Cleanup

```bash
# Delete entries older than 30 days
synapse history cleanup --days 30

# Keep database under 100MB
synapse history cleanup --max-size 100

# Preview what would be deleted
synapse history cleanup --days 30 --dry-run

# Skip VACUUM after deletion (faster)
synapse history cleanup --days 30 --no-vacuum
```

### Trace Task

Trace a task across history and file modifications:

```bash
synapse trace <task_id>
```

Shows task history combined with file-safety records for the specified task.

## Settings Management

### Initialize Settings

```bash
# Interactive - prompts for scope selection
synapse init

# Output:
# ? Where do you want to create .synapse/?
#   ❯ User scope (~/.synapse/)
#     Project scope (./.synapse/)
```

Creates or updates `.synapse/` directory by merging all files from `synapse/templates/.synapse/` into the target. User-generated data (agents/, databases, sessions/, workflows/, worktrees/) is preserved — only template files are overwritten.

### Edit Settings (Interactive TUI)

```bash
# Interactive TUI for editing settings
synapse config

# Use legacy questionary-based interface instead of Rich TUI
synapse config --no-rich

# Edit specific scope directly (skip scope selection prompt)
synapse config --scope user     # Edit ~/.synapse/settings.json
synapse config --scope project  # Edit ./.synapse/settings.json

# View current settings (read-only)
synapse config show                    # Show merged settings from all scopes
synapse config show --scope user       # Show user settings only

**list.columns:**

Configure which columns to display in `synapse list`:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ID` | Runtime ID (e.g., `synapse-claude-8100`) |
| `NAME` | Custom name if set |
| `TYPE` | Agent type (claude, gemini, etc.) |
| `ROLE` | Role description |
| `STATUS` | READY/WAITING/PROCESSING/DONE/SHUTTING_DOWN |
| `CURRENT` | Current task preview |
| `TRANSPORT` | UDS/TCP communication status |
| `WORKING_DIR` | Working directory |
| `EDITING_FILE` | Currently locked file (requires file-safety) |

**approvalMode:**

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `required` | Show approval prompt before sending initial instructions (default) |
| `auto` | Skip approval prompt, send instructions automatically |

## Instructions Management

Manage initial instructions sent to agents at startup.

```bash
# Show instruction content for an agent type
synapse instructions show claude
synapse instructions show gemini
synapse instructions show  # Shows default

# List instruction files used
synapse instructions files claude
# Output shows file locations:
#   - .synapse/default.md       (project directory)

# Send initial instructions to a running agent (useful after --resume)
synapse instructions send claude

# Preview what would be sent without actually sending
synapse instructions send claude --preview

# Send to specific Runtime ID
synapse instructions send synapse-claude-8100
```

**Use case:** If you started an agent with `--resume` (which skips initial instructions) and later need the A2A protocol information, use `synapse instructions send <agent>` to inject the instructions.

**Optional instruction files:** Additional instruction files are automatically appended based on settings:
- `file-safety.md` — appended when `SYNAPSE_FILE_SAFETY_ENABLED=true`
- `learning.md` — appended when either `SYNAPSE_LEARNING_MODE_ENABLED=true` or `SYNAPSE_LEARNING_MODE_TRANSLATION=true` is set (the two flags are independent). `SYNAPSE_LEARNING_MODE_ENABLED` adds a PROMPT IMPROVEMENT section; `SYNAPSE_LEARNING_MODE_TRANSLATION` adds a JP-to-EN LEARNING section (English pattern template, slot mapping, assembled prompt with JP paraphrase, quick alternatives). Either flag alone or both together enable `learning.md` injection and TIPS. The RESPONSE section uses normal formatting (no separators or section headers); structured format (━━━ separators, numbered sub-sections) is only for the learning feedback sections (PROMPT IMPROVEMENT / JP → EN LEARNING / TIPS). Template uses `{{#learning_mode}}`/`{{#learning_translation}}` Mustache conditionals for layout switching.
- `proactive.md` — appended when `SYNAPSE_PROACTIVE_MODE_ENABLED=true`. Injects a mandatory per-task checklist requiring agents to use task board, shared memory, file safety, canvas, and broadcast for every task regardless of size. See the Features reference for details.

synapse auth setup
```

Generates API key and admin key, then shows setup instructions including environment variable exports and curl examples.

### Generate API Key

```bash
# Generate a single key
synapse auth generate-key

export SYNAPSE_AUTH_ENABLED=true
export SYNAPSE_API_KEYS=<key>
export SYNAPSE_ADMIN_KEY=<admin_key>
synapse claude
```

### Reset Settings

```bash
# Interactive scope selection
synapse reset

# Reset specific scope
synapse reset --scope user
synapse reset --scope project
synapse reset --scope both

# Force reset without confirmation
synapse reset --scope both -f
```

**Parameters:**
- `--scope`: Which settings to reset (`user`, `project`, or `both`)
- `-f, --force`: Skip confirmation prompt

Resets `settings.json` to defaults and re-copies skills from `.claude` to `.agents`.

## Shared Memory

Cross-agent knowledge sharing via a project-local SQLite database (`.synapse/memory.db`).

Enabled by default (`SYNAPSE_SHARED_MEMORY_ENABLED=true`). To disable: `SYNAPSE_SHARED_MEMORY_ENABLED=false`.

### Save Memory

```bash
# Save a knowledge entry (UPSERT on key — updates if key already exists)
synapse memory save auth-pattern "Use OAuth2 with PKCE flow"

# Save with tags for categorization
synapse memory save auth-pattern "Use OAuth2 with PKCE flow" --tags auth,security

# Save and broadcast notification to all cwd agents
synapse memory save auth-pattern "Use OAuth2 with PKCE flow" --notify
```

**Parameters:**
- `key`: Unique key for this memory (e.g., `auth-pattern`). Used as the UPSERT key.
- `content`: Memory content text.
- `--tags`: Comma-separated tags for categorization.
- `--notify`: After saving, broadcast a notification to all agents in the current working directory.

**Author:** Automatically set to `$SYNAPSE_AGENT_ID` (the agent's own ID).

### List Memories

```bash
# List all memories (most recently updated first)
synapse memory list

# Filter by author
synapse memory list --author synapse-claude-8100

# Filter by tags
synapse memory list --tags arch,security

# Limit results
synapse memory list --limit 10
```

### Show Memory Details

```bash
# Show full details of a memory by key or ID
synapse memory show auth-pattern
synapse memory show <uuid>
```

### Search Memories

```bash
# Search across key, content, and tags (LIKE matching)
# Results are bounded (default limit: 100, ordered by most recently updated)
synapse memory search "OAuth2"
synapse memory search "database"
```

### Delete Memory

```bash
# Delete with confirmation prompt
synapse memory delete auth-pattern

# Delete without confirmation
synapse memory delete auth-pattern --force
```

### Memory Statistics

```bash
# Show total count, per-author, and per-tag breakdown
synapse memory stats
```

### Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SYNAPSE_SHARED_MEMORY_ENABLED` | Enable shared memory | `true` |
| `SYNAPSE_SHARED_MEMORY_DB_PATH` | Database file path | `.synapse/memory.db` |

**Storage:** `.synapse/memory.db` (SQLite with WAL mode, project-local)

## Shared Task Board

Coordinate tasks across agents with dependency tracking.

```bash
# List all tasks
synapse tasks list

# Filter by status or agent
synapse tasks list --status pending
synapse tasks list --agent claude

# Create a task
synapse tasks create "Implement auth module" -d "OAuth2 flow with JWT tokens"

# Create with dependency (blocked until blocker completes)
synapse tasks create "Write integration tests" --blocked-by <task_id>

# Claim/assign a task
synapse tasks assign <task_id> claude

# Complete a task (auto-unblocks dependents)
synapse tasks complete <task_id>
```

### Task Failure and Recovery

```bash
# Report task failure (only works on in_progress tasks you own)
synapse tasks fail <task_id> --reason "Test suite failed"

# Reopen a completed or failed task (returns to pending, clears assignee)
synapse tasks reopen <task_id>
```

### Task Priority

Tasks have priority 1-5 (default 3). Higher priority tasks are served first by `get_available_tasks()`.

```bash
# Create task with priority
synapse tasks create "Critical fix" -d "Fix auth bug" --priority 5

# Priority ordering in available tasks
synapse tasks list --status pending
# Returns: priority 5 first, then 4, 3, 2, 1
```

### Task Board Workflow (Kanban Pattern)

The manager agent (delegate-mode) monitors TaskBoard and orchestrates worker agents:

```bash
# Step 1: Manager creates task chain
# synapse tasks create prints "Created task: <id> - <subject> (priority=N)"
# Use awk to extract the task ID (short UUID)
T1=$(synapse tasks create "Write tests" --priority 5 | awk '{print $3}')
T2=$(synapse tasks create "Implement" --blocked-by $T1 --priority 4 | awk '{print $3}')
T3=$(synapse tasks create "Review" --blocked-by $T2 --priority 3 | awk '{print $3}')

# Step 2: Manager assigns available tasks and notifies worker
synapse tasks assign $T1 claude
synapse send claude "Write tests for auth module" --silent

# Step 3: Worker reports completion
synapse tasks complete $T1
# → $T2 becomes available (unblocked)

# Step 4: Handle failure
synapse tasks fail $T2 --reason "Missing dependency"
synapse tasks reopen $T2   # Back to pending for retry
```

### A2A API Endpoints

```
POST /tasks/board                          # Create task
GET  /tasks/board                          # List tasks
POST /tasks/board/{task_id}/claim          # Claim task
POST /tasks/board/{task_id}/complete       # Complete task
POST /tasks/board/{task_id}/fail           # Fail task (preserves assignee, no unblock)
POST /tasks/board/{task_id}/reopen         # Reopen completed/failed task to pending
```

**Storage:** `.synapse/task_board.db` (SQLite with WAL mode)

## Plan Approval

Review and approve agent plans before implementation.

```bash
# Approve a plan
synapse approve <task_id>

# Reject with reason
synapse reject <task_id> --reason "Use OAuth instead of JWT"
```

**Plan mode:** When `metadata.plan_mode = true` is set in a send request, the agent creates a plan without implementing.

## Team Start (Auto-Spawn Panes)

Start multiple agents in split terminal panes.

**Default behavior:** The 1st agent takes over the current terminal (handoff via `os.execvp`), and remaining agents start in new panes. Use `--all-new` to start all agents in new panes (current terminal stays).

Agent specs use `profile[:name[:role[:skill_set[:port]]]]` format. `--no-setup --headless` are always added to spawned agents. Ports are pre-allocated by the parent process to avoid race conditions when multiple agents of the same type start simultaneously.

```bash
# Default: claude=current terminal, gemini=new pane
synapse team start claude gemini

# With names, roles, and skill sets
synapse team start claude:Reviewer:code-review:reviewer gemini:Searcher

# All agents in new panes (current terminal remains)
synapse team start claude gemini --all-new

# Horizontal layout
synapse team start claude gemini --layout horizontal

# Pass tool-specific arguments after '--' (automation args: unattended/permission-skip args such as --dangerously-skip-permissions, --approval-mode=yolo, --full-auto)
# Keep teams homogeneous when forwarding CLI-specific args to all agents.
synapse team start claude claude -- --dangerously-skip-permissions
synapse team start gemini gemini -- --approval-mode=yolo
synapse team start codex codex -- --full-auto
synapse team start copilot copilot -- --allow-all-tools

# Worktree isolation (Synapse-level flag, before '--'; creates per-agent worktrees for ALL agent types)
synapse team start claude gemini --worktree
synapse team start claude gemini codex -w my-feature  # Named prefix: my-feature-claude-0, my-feature-gemini-1, etc.
```

**Supported terminals:** tmux, iTerm2, Terminal.app (tabs), Ghostty (split panes via Cmd+D), zellij. Falls back to sequential start if unsupported. **Ghostty Note:** Ghostty uses AppleScript to target the focused tab. Do not switch tabs while the team is being spawned.

### Team Start via A2A API

Agents can spawn teams programmatically via the `/team/start` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/team/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agents": ["gemini", "codex"], "layout": "split"}'

# With tool_args (passed through to the underlying CLI tool; automation args are recommended for unattended agents)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/team/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agents": ["gemini", "gemini"], "tool_args": ["--approval-mode=yolo"]}'
# Note: tool_args are passed to ALL agents. Keep teams homogeneous when using CLI-specific args:
# Claude: ["--dangerously-skip-permissions"], Gemini: ["--approval-mode=yolo"], Codex: ["--full-auto"], Copilot: ["--allow-all-tools"]
```

### Spawn via A2A API

Agents can spawn other agents programmatically via the `/spawn` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/spawn \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"profile": "gemini", "name": "Helper"}'
# Response: {"agent_id": "synapse-gemini-8110", "port": 8110, "terminal_used": "tmux", "status": "submitted"}

# With skill_set and tool_args
curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/spawn \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"profile": "gemini", "skill_set": "dev-set", "tool_args": ["--approval-mode=yolo"]}'
# Per-CLI tool_args: Claude ["--dangerously-skip-permissions"], Gemini ["--approval-mode=yolo"], Codex ["--full-auto"], Copilot ["--allow-all-tools"]

# With worktree isolation (works for all agent types)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/spawn \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"profile": "gemini", "name": "Worker", "worktree": true}'
# Named worktree:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/spawn \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"profile": "claude", "name": "Impl", "worktree": "feat-auth"}'
# Response with worktree: {"agent_id": "...", "port": ..., "terminal_used": "...", "status": "submitted", "worktree_path": ".synapse/worktrees/feat-auth", "worktree_branch": "worktree-feat-auth", "worktree_base_branch": "origin/main"}

# On failure: {"status": "failed", "reason": "No available port"}
```

## Session Save/Restore

Save running team configurations as named snapshots and restore them later. Each session captures agent profiles, names, roles, skill sets, worktree settings, and `session_id` (CLI conversation identifier) as a JSON file.

### Save Session

```bash
# Save all agents in current directory as a session (project scope by default)
synapse session save my-team

# Save to user scope (~/.synapse/sessions/)
synapse session save my-team --user

# Save agents matching a specific working directory
synapse session save my-team --workdir /path/to/project
```

**Scope filter behavior:**
- Default (project): captures agents whose `working_dir` matches `CWD`, saves to `.synapse/sessions/`
- `--user`: captures all running agents regardless of directory, saves to `~/.synapse/sessions/`
- `--workdir DIR`: captures agents matching the specified directory, saves to `DIR/.synapse/sessions/`

**`session_id` capture:** Each agent's CLI conversation identifier (if available) is read from the registry and stored in the session JSON. This enables `--resume` during restore to target the exact conversation.

### List Sessions

```bash
# List all saved sessions (project + user)
synapse session list

# List user-scope sessions only
synapse session list --user

# List project-scope sessions only
synapse session list --project
```

Output columns: NAME, AGENTS (count), SCOPE, WORKING_DIR, CREATED. Rich table in TTY, plain text otherwise.

### Show Session Details

```bash
synapse session show my-team
```

Displays session name, scope, working directory, creation timestamp, agent count, and per-agent details (profile, name, role, skill_set, worktree, session_id).

### Restore Session

```bash
# Restore a saved session (spawns all agents)
synapse session restore my-team

# Override worktree setting for all agents
synapse session restore my-team --worktree
synapse session restore my-team -w

# Resume each agent's previous CLI session (conversation history)
synapse session restore my-team --resume

# Combine resume with worktree and tool args
synapse session restore my-team --resume --worktree -- --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Pass tool args to spawned agents (after '--')
synapse session restore my-team -- --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

Each agent in the session is spawned via `spawn_agent()`. The `--worktree` / `-w` flag overrides the saved worktree setting for all agents. Tool args after `--` are passed through to the underlying CLI.

**`--resume` flag:**

When `--resume` is specified, each agent receives CLI-specific resume arguments built from `build_resume_args()`. If the session snapshot includes a `session_id` for an agent, the resume targets that specific conversation; otherwise, the latest session is resumed.

| Profile | With `session_id` | Without `session_id` |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| claude | `--resume <id>` | `--continue` |
| gemini | `--resume <id>` | `--resume` |
| codex | `resume <id>` | `resume --last` |
| copilot | `--resume` | `--resume` |
| opencode | *(no support)* | *(no support)* |

**Shell-level fallback:** If the resume command exits with a non-zero status within 10 seconds (e.g., session ID not found), the agent is automatically retried without resume args. This prevents a missing session from blocking the entire restore. Failures after 10 seconds (e.g., a long-running agent crashing) do not trigger the fallback.

### Delete Session

```bash
# Delete with confirmation prompt
synapse session delete my-team

# Delete without confirmation
synapse session delete my-team --force
synapse session delete my-team -f
```

### Session Name Rules

Session names must start with an alphanumeric character and contain only alphanumeric characters, dots, hyphens, or underscores (same rules as worktree names).

### Storage

```text
.synapse/sessions/<name>.json        # Project scope (default)
~/.synapse/sessions/<name>.json      # User scope (--user)
DIR/.synapse/sessions/<name>.json    # Custom project scope (--workdir DIR)
```

## Workflow Automation

Define multi-step agent workflows as YAML files and execute them sequentially.

### Create Workflow Template

```bash
# Generate a template YAML file
synapse workflow create review-and-test
```

Creates a starter YAML at the project scope (`.synapse/workflows/review-and-test.yaml`) with example steps that you can customize.

### List Workflows

```bash
# List all saved workflows (project + user)
synapse workflow list

# List project-scope workflows only
synapse workflow list --project

# List user-scope workflows only
synapse workflow list --user
```

### Show Workflow Details

```bash
# Show step-by-step details of a workflow
synapse workflow show review-and-test
```

Displays workflow name, description, scope, and each step's target, message, priority, and response mode.

### Run Workflow

```bash
# Execute all steps sequentially
synapse workflow run review-and-test

# Preview steps without executing
synapse workflow run review-and-test --dry-run

# Continue executing remaining steps even if one fails
synapse workflow run review-and-test --continue-on-error
```

Steps are executed in order. Each step sends a message to the specified target agent using the configured priority and response mode. By default, execution stops on the first failure unless `--continue-on-error` is set.

### Delete Workflow

```bash
# Delete with confirmation prompt
synapse workflow delete review-and-test

# Delete without confirmation
synapse workflow delete review-and-test --force
```

### YAML Format

```yaml
name: review-and-test
description: "Send review to Claude, then tests to Gemini"
steps:
  - target: claude
    message: "Review the changes"
    priority: 4
    response_mode: wait
  - target: gemini
    message: "Write tests"
    response_mode: silent
```

**Step fields:**

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `target` | Yes | — | Agent target (name, type, ID) |
| `message` | Yes | — | Message to send |
| `priority` | No | `3` | Priority level (1-5) |
| `response_mode` | No | `notify` | `wait`, `notify`, or `silent` |

### Storage

```text
.synapse/workflows/<name>.yaml        # Project scope (default)
~/.synapse/workflows/<name>.yaml      # User scope
```

## Skill Management

Manage skills across scopes with a central store (`~/.synapse/skills/`).

### Interactive TUI

```bash
synapse skills
```

### Non-Interactive Commands

```bash
# List and browse
synapse skills list                                # All scopes
synapse skills list --scope synapse                # Central store only
synapse skills show <name>                         # Skill details

# Manage
synapse skills delete <name> [--force]
synapse skills move <name> --to <scope>

# Central store operations
synapse skills import <name> [--from user|project] # Import to ~/.synapse/skills/
synapse skills deploy <name> --agent claude,codex --scope user  # Deploy from central store
synapse skills add <repo>                          # Install from repo (npx skills wrapper)
synapse skills create [--name <name>]              # Create new skill template

# Skill sets (named groups)
synapse skills set list
synapse skills set show <name>

### Apply Skill Set to Running Agent

Apply a skill set to a running agent. This command copies skill files to the agent's skill directory, updates the registry, and re-injects skill set information via A2A.

```bash
synapse skills apply <target> <set_name> [--dry-run]
```

**Parameters:**
- `target`: Target agent (name, ID, type-port, or agent type)
- `set_name`: Name of the skill set to apply (e.g., `developer`, `architect`)
- `--dry-run`: Preview changes without applying them

**Example:**
```bash
synapse skills apply my-claude manager
synapse skills apply gemini-8110 developer --dry-run
```

**Default Skill Sets (6):**

| Set | Description | Skills (+ synapse-a2a base) |
|-----|-------------|----------------------------|
| `architect` | System architecture and design — design docs, API contracts, code review | system-design, api-design, code-review, project-docs |
| `developer` | Implementation and quality — test-first development, refactoring, code simplification | test-first, refactoring, code-simplifier, agent-memory |
| `reviewer` | Code review and security — structured reviews, security audits, code simplification | code-review, security-audit, code-simplifier |
| `frontend` | Frontend development — React/Next.js performance, component composition, design systems, accessibility | react-performance, frontend-design, react-composition, web-accessibility |
| `manager` | Multi-agent management — task delegation, progress monitoring, quality verification, cross-review orchestration, re-instruction | synapse-manager, task-planner, agent-memory, code-review, synapse-reinst |
| `documentation` | Documentation expert — audit, restructure, synchronize, and maintain project documentation | project-docs, doc-organizer, api-design, agent-memory |

**Skill Set in Initial Instructions:** When an agent starts with a skill set (via `--skill-set` or interactive selection), the skill set details (name, description, included skills) are automatically included in the agent's initial instructions. This allows the agent to understand its assigned capabilities.

### Skill Scopes

| Scope | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Synapse** | `~/.synapse/skills/` | Central store (deploy to agents from here) |

## CI Monitoring and Auto-Fix Skills

Automated hooks and companion skills for monitoring CI, merge conflicts, and code reviews.

### CI Monitoring Hooks

PostToolUse hooks in `.claude/hooks/` automatically launch background monitors after `git push` or `gh pr create`:

- **`check-ci-trigger.sh`**: Detects `git push` and `gh pr create` in Bash tool invocations, then launches:
  - **`poll-ci.sh`**: Polls GitHub Actions until the run completes. Reports pass/fail via `systemMessage`. On failure, suggests `/fix-ci` (up to 2 auto-fix attempts before recommending manual intervention).
  - **`poll-pr-status.sh`**: Checks PR mergeable state (conflict detection) and waits for CodeRabbit review. Reports merge conflicts (suggests `/fix-conflict`) and classifies review comments by severity (suggests `/fix-review` for actionable issues).

### Check CI Status

```
/check-ci          # Show CI checks + merge conflict state + CodeRabbit review
/check-ci --fix    # Show status and suggest fix commands for issues found
/check-ci --wait   # Report if CI is still running
```

Reports:
- GitHub Actions check results (pass/fail/running/pending)
- Merge conflict state (MERGEABLE / CONFLICTING / computing)
- CodeRabbit review comment count and classification

With `--fix`, suggests `/fix-conflict`, `/fix-ci`, or `/fix-review` in priority order.

### Fix CI Failures

```
/fix-ci             # Auto-diagnose and fix CI failures
/fix-ci --dry-run   # Preview fixes without applying
```

Workflow: fetch failed logs -> categorize (format/lint/type/test) -> apply targeted fixes -> verify locally -> commit and push. Max 1 retry per failure category.

### Fix Merge Conflicts

```
/fix-conflict             # Auto-resolve merge conflicts
/fix-conflict --dry-run   # Show conflicts without resolving
```

Workflow: fetch base branch -> test merge -> identify conflicts -> analyze both sides -> resolve -> verify (ruff + pytest) -> commit and push. Aborts on binary conflicts or >10 conflicting files.

### Fix CodeRabbit Review Comments

```
/fix-review             # Auto-fix actionable CodeRabbit comments
/fix-review --dry-run   # Preview without applying
/fix-review --all       # Also attempt suggestion-category fixes
```

Workflow: fetch PR reviews from `coderabbitai[bot]` -> classify comments (Bug/Security, Style, Suggestion) -> apply fixes for actionable categories -> verify locally -> commit and push.

**Comment Classification:**
- **Bug/Security** (auto-fix): issues with `⚠️ Potential issue`, `🐛 Bug`, `🔒 Security` headers or bug-related keywords
- **Style** (auto-fix): nitpicks, formatting, naming issues; delegates to `ruff check --fix` and `ruff format` when applicable
- **Suggestion** (report only): refactoring ideas, performance hints; only auto-fixed with `--all` flag

## Canvas Board

Canvas is a shared visual dashboard where agents post rich content cards rendered in the browser. The UI is a single-page application (SPA) with four views navigated via hash routing:

- **`#/`** (Canvas view) — Spotlight layout showing the latest card prominently
- **`#/dashboard`** (Dashboard view) — Operational overview with expandable summary+detail widgets (Agents, Tasks, File Locks, Worktrees, Memory, Errors)
- **`#/history`** (History view) — Grid layout with filters, live feed, and agent messages
- **`#/system`** (System panel) — Configuration view (tips, saved agents, skills, skill sets, sessions, workflows, environment)

### Post Cards

```bash
# Post a Mermaid diagram
synapse canvas post mermaid "graph TD; A-->B" --title "Architecture" --pinned

# Post markdown
synapse canvas post markdown "## Summary\nAll tests pass" --title "Report"

# Post a table
synapse canvas post table '{"headers":["Test","Status"],"rows":[["auth","pass"],["api","pass"]]}' --title "Results"

# Post code with language hint (syntax highlighted via highlight.js)
synapse canvas post code "def hello(): pass" --lang python --title "Snippet"

# Post a Chart.js chart (supports bar, line, pie, doughnut, radar, polarArea, scatter, bubble)
synapse canvas post chart '{"type":"bar","data":{"labels":["A","B"],"datasets":[{"data":[10,20]}]}}' --title "Metrics"
synapse canvas post chart '{"type":"pie","data":{"labels":["Pass","Fail"],"datasets":[{"data":[95,5]}]}}' --title "Results"

synapse canvas post progress '{"current": 3, "total": 7, "label": "Migration", "steps": ["Schema", "Data", "Indexes", "Views", "Triggers", "Constraints", "Verify"], "status": "in_progress"}' --title "Migration Progress"

# Post terminal output (preserves ANSI escape codes)
synapse canvas post terminal "$(cat build.log)" --title "Build Output"

# Post a dependency graph (nodes + edges)
synapse canvas post dependency-graph '{"nodes": [{"id": "auth", "group": "core"}, {"id": "api", "group": "core"}, {"id": "ui", "group": "frontend"}], "edges": [{"from": "ui", "to": "api"}, {"from": "api", "to": "auth"}]}' --title "Module Dependencies"

# Post a cost summary
synapse canvas post cost '{"agents": [{"name": "claude", "input_tokens": 50000, "output_tokens": 12000, "cost": 0.45}, {"name": "gemini", "input_tokens": 30000, "output_tokens": 8000, "cost": 0.12}], "total_cost": 0.57, "currency": "USD"}' --title "Session Cost"

# Post raw JSON (composite cards with multiple content blocks)
synapse canvas post-raw '{"type":"render","agent_id":"cli","content":[{"format":"markdown","body":"# Title"},{"format":"code","body":"x=1","lang":"python"}],"title":"Composite"}'
```

**Supported formats (22):** mermaid, markdown, html, table, json, diff, code, chart, image, log, status, metric, checklist, timeline, alert, file-preview, trace, task-board, progress, terminal, dependency-graph, cost

### Templates

Templates control how composite content blocks are displayed. Each template has its own `template_data` schema. The `CanvasMessage` fields `template` (str) and `template_data` (dict) select and configure the layout.

**5 templates:** briefing, comparison, dashboard, steps, slides

```bash
# Post a briefing (structured report with sections referencing content blocks)
synapse canvas briefing '{"title":"Sprint","sections":[{"title":"Tests","blocks":[0]}],"content":[{"format":"markdown","body":"## Results"}]}' --pinned
synapse canvas briefing --file report.json --title "CI Report"

# Post via post-raw with template field (works for all 5 templates)
synapse canvas post-raw '{"type":"render","agent_id":"cli","template":"comparison","template_data":{"sides":[{"label":"Before","blocks":[0]},{"label":"After","blocks":[1]}]},"content":[{"format":"code","body":"old","lang":"python"},{"format":"code","body":"new","lang":"python"}],"title":"Diff"}'
```

**Template data schemas:**

| Template | Required `template_data` | Description |
|----------|--------------------------|-------------|
| briefing | `{"sections": [{"title": str, "blocks?": [int]}], "summary?": str}` | Structured report with collapsible sections |
| comparison | `{"sides": [{"label": str, "blocks": [int]}], "layout?": "side-by-side"\|"stacked", "summary?": str}` | 2-to-4-way side-by-side or stacked comparison |
| dashboard | `{"widgets": [{"title": str, "blocks": [int], "size?": "1x1"\|"2x1"\|"1x2"\|"2x2"}], "cols?": int}` | Grid layout with resizable widget cells (1-4 columns) |
| steps | `{"steps": [{"title": str, "blocks?": [int], "done?": bool, "description?": str}], "summary?": str}` | Linear workflow with completion tracking |
| slides | `{"slides": [{"title?": str, "blocks": [int], "notes?": str}]}` | Page-by-page navigation |

### Template Selection Guide

- `briefing`: use for implementation reports, review notes, release summaries, and any output that benefits from sections + summaries
- `comparison`: use for before/after diffs, option trade-offs, and architecture choices with parallel evidence
- `steps`: use for rollout plans, migration procedures, bug-fix sequences, and checklist-driven execution
- `slides`: use for walkthroughs, demos, and content that should be consumed one page at a time
- `dashboard`: use for operational snapshots with multiple small widgets, counts, and mixed status blocks

Rule of thumb:
- One block, one idea: plain `synapse canvas post`
- Many blocks, structured story: choose a template

### Rendering Details

| Format | Renderer | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| code | highlight.js 11.x | Syntax highlighting; set `--lang` for best results |
| chart | Chart.js 4.x | All chart types: bar, line, pie, doughnut, radar, polarArea, scatter, bubble |
| diff | Side-by-side | Parsed into left (deletions) / right (additions) columns |
| html | Sandboxed iframe | `allow-scripts`; auto-resizes to content height |
| image | `<img>` tag | PNG, JPEG, SVG, GIF, WebP via URL or Base64 data URI (up to 2MB) |
| mermaid | Mermaid 11.x | Diagrams rendered client-side; theme-synced with light/dark toggle (Catppuccin dark / Indigo light palettes, brand accent `#4051b5`) |
| progress | Progress bar + steps | `status`: in_progress, completed, failed, paused |
| terminal | ANSI terminal | Renders raw terminal output with ANSI escape codes |
| dependency-graph | Force-directed graph | Nodes with optional `group` colouring; directed edges |
| cost | Cost summary table | Per-agent token counts and costs with total row |

### Manage Cards

```bash
synapse canvas list                      # List all cards
synapse canvas list --agent-id claude    # Filter by agent
synapse canvas list --type markdown      # Filter by content type
synapse canvas list --search "Auth"      # Search by title
synapse canvas delete <card_id> --agent-id <id>  # Delete own card
synapse canvas clear                     # Clear all cards
synapse canvas clear --agent-id <id>     # Clear agent's cards
```

### Server Management

```bash
synapse canvas serve [--port 3000]       # Start server foreground
synapse canvas open                      # Open in browser (auto-starts server)
synapse canvas status                    # Show server status (version, PID, mismatch detection)
synapse canvas logs [-n 50] [-f]         # View server logs
synapse canvas stop [--port/-p 3000]     # Stop server (verifies process identity before kill)
```

**Auto-start:** The server starts automatically when you post the first card or run `canvas open`. Stale Canvas processes (e.g., leftover from a previous session) are detected and auto-replaced. Cards are auto-cleaned after 1 hour (pinned cards are exempt).

**Process management:** PID file is stored at `~/.synapse/canvas.pid`. `canvas status` cross-checks the PID file against `/api/health` to detect mismatches. `canvas stop` verifies the target PID is actually a Canvas process before sending SIGTERM.

**Canvas proxy:** Each agent's A2A server exposes `/canvas/cards` endpoints, so agents can post cards through their own port without knowing the Canvas server port.

## MCP Bootstrap Server

```bash
# Start MCP server over stdio (for MCP client integration)
synapse mcp serve [--agent-id ID] [--agent-type TYPE] [--port PORT]

# Module entrypoint (recommended for client configs — uses repo-pinned version)
uv run --directory /path/to/synapse-a2a python -m synapse.mcp --agent-id synapse-claude-8100 --agent-type claude --port 8100
```

**Defaults:** `--agent-id` defaults to `$SYNAPSE_AGENT_ID` or `synapse-mcp`. `--agent-type` is auto-extracted from the agent ID if not specified.

**MCP methods supported:** `initialize`, `resources/list`, `resources/read`, `tools/list`, `tools/call` (for `bootstrap_agent`).

**Automatic PTY skip:** When Synapse detects a Synapse MCP server config entry for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, or OpenCode, PTY startup instruction injection is automatically skipped. Non-Synapse MCP entries do not trigger the skip. Copilot is unchanged and continues to use PTY bootstrap.
