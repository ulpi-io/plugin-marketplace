## Important: Tennis is Not a Team Sport

- **Tournaments, not games**: Events are multi-day tournaments containing many matches.
- **Individual athletes**: Competitors are individual players (singles) or pairs (doubles), not teams.
- **Set-based scoring**: Scores are per-set game counts (e.g., 6-4, 7-5), not quarters.
- **Rankings, not standings**: Players have ATP/WTA ranking points, not team records.
- **No rosters or team schedules**: Tennis has no team-level commands.

## The `tour` Parameter

- **ATP**: Men's professional tennis tour
- **WTA**: Women's professional tennis tour

If the user just says "tennis" without specifying a tour, ask which one or show both by calling the command twice.
