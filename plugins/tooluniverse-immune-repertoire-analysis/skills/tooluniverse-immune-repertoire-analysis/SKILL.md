# ToolUniverse Immune Repertoire Analysis

Comprehensive skill for analyzing T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire sequencing data to characterize adaptive immune responses, clonal expansion, and antigen specificity.

## Overview

Adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) enables comprehensive profiling of T-cell and B-cell populations through high-throughput sequencing of TCR and BCR variable regions. This skill provides an 8-phase workflow for:
- Clonotype identification and tracking
- Diversity and clonality assessment
- V(D)J gene usage analysis
- CDR3 sequence characterization
- Clonal expansion and convergence detection
- Epitope specificity prediction
- Integration with single-cell phenotyping
- Longitudinal repertoire tracking

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Data Import & Clonotype Definition

Load AIRR-seq data from common formats (MiXCR, ImmunoSEQ, AIRR standard, 10x Genomics VDJ). Standardize columns to: `cloneId`, `count`, `frequency`, `cdr3aa`, `cdr3nt`, `v_gene`, `j_gene`, `chain`. Define clonotypes using one of three methods:
- **cdr3aa**: Amino acid CDR3 sequence only
- **cdr3nt**: Nucleotide CDR3 sequence
- **vj_cdr3**: V gene + J gene + CDR3aa (most common, recommended)

Aggregate by clonotype, sort by count, assign ranks.

### Phase 2: Diversity & Clonality Analysis

Calculate diversity metrics for the repertoire:
- **Shannon entropy**: Overall diversity (higher = more diverse)
- **Simpson index**: Probability two random clones are same
- **Inverse Simpson**: Effective number of clonotypes
- **Gini coefficient**: Inequality in clonotype distribution
- **Clonality**: 1 - Pielou's evenness (higher = more clonal)
- **Richness**: Number of unique clonotypes

Generate rarefaction curves to assess whether sequencing depth is sufficient.

### Phase 3: V(D)J Gene Usage Analysis

Analyze V and J gene usage patterns weighted by clonotype count:
- V gene family usage frequencies
- J gene family usage frequencies
- V-J pairing frequencies
- Statistical testing for biased usage (chi-square test vs. uniform expectation)

### Phase 4: CDR3 Sequence Analysis

Characterize CDR3 sequences:
- **Length distribution**: Typical TCR CDR3 = 12-18 aa; BCR CDR3 = 10-20 aa
- **Amino acid composition**: Weighted by clonotype frequency
- Flag unusual length distributions (may indicate PCR bias)

### Phase 5: Clonal Expansion Detection

Identify expanded clonotypes above a frequency threshold (default: 95th percentile). Track clonotypes longitudinally across multiple timepoints to measure persistence, mean/max frequency, and fold changes.

### Phase 6: Convergence & Public Clonotypes

- **Convergent recombination**: Same CDR3 amino acid from different nucleotide sequences (evidence of antigen-driven selection)
- **Public clonotypes**: Shared across multiple samples/individuals (may indicate common antigen responses)

### Phase 7: Epitope Prediction & Specificity

Query epitope databases for known TCR-epitope associations:
- **IEDB** (`IEDB_search_tcells`): Search by CDR3 receptor sequence
- **VDJdb** (manual): https://vdjdb.cdr3.net/search
- **PubMed literature** (`PubMed_search`): Search for CDR3 + epitope/antigen/specificity

### Phase 8: Integration with Single-Cell Data

Link TCR/BCR clonotypes to cell phenotypes from paired single-cell RNA-seq:
- Map clonotypes to cell barcodes
- Identify expanded clonotype phenotypes on UMAP
- Analyze clonotype-cluster associations (cross-tabulation)
- Find cluster-specific clonotypes (>80% cells in one cluster)
- Differential gene expression: expanded vs. non-expanded cells

## Quick Start

```python
from tooluniverse import ToolUniverse

# 1. Load data
tcr_data = load_airr_data("clonotypes.txt", format='mixcr')

# 2. Define clonotypes
clonotypes = define_clonotypes(tcr_data, method='vj_cdr3')

# 3. Calculate diversity
diversity = calculate_diversity(clonotypes['count'])
print(f"Shannon entropy: {diversity['shannon_entropy']:.2f}")

# 4. Detect expanded clones
expansion = detect_expanded_clones(clonotypes)
print(f"Expanded clonotypes: {expansion['n_expanded']}")

# 5. Analyze V(D)J usage
vdj_usage = analyze_vdj_usage(tcr_data)

# 6. Query epitope databases
top_clones = expansion['expanded_clonotypes']['clonotype'].head(10)
epitopes = query_epitope_database(top_clones)
```
